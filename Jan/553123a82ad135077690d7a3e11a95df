Leader of the group, Mr Ezekiel Elom Ogbonna, also lauded he governor for appointing Pastor Eze Nwachukwu Eze as a commissioner in the state. NRG USA is a social cultural organization founded in New York City to seek collaboration of Ngboejeogu natives in diaspora towards championing a broadbased platform for socio-economic emancipation of Ngboejeogu persons who are gifted in any form which will ensure their advancement. Ogbonna in a statement said: “We are delighted at this development in our town’s political evolution, though we recognize that people of Ngbo extraction have enjoyed a chunk of patronage from the present government in the state in different forms, elevating Eze to a position of full commissioner places us closer to the highest decision making spot in state’s administrative organogram.
