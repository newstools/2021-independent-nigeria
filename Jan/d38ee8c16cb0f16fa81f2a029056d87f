African champions of economic growth in 2021 are Djibouti, Kenya, Tunisia, Rwanda and Botswana respectively, according to World Bank projections published in its January 2021 World Economic Outlook report. After the difficult year 2020, marked by a decline in growth and recession in many African countries due to the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, the Bank believes that the continent will be able to start an economic recovery this year. In this perspective, World Bank experts estimate that 47 of the 55 African countries should record a rebound in economic activity and no less than 12 countries should experience economic growth above 5 per cent.
