LAGOS- Committee for Defense of Human Right (CDHR) has condemned the recent arrest of Omoyele Sowore, former presidential candidate and convener of #RevolutionNow. The rights group in a chat with DAILY INDEPENDENT said that the government of President  Muhammadu Buhari has resorted to taking away the right to liberty of Nigerian  citizens as an Avenue to stifle dissent. It states that the All Progressives  Congress (APC) led government has continued to constitute itself into a cog in the wheel of progress in Nigeria. Speaking on behalf of CDHR, Osagie Obayuwana, national president of the group, stated that it seemed that the Buhari government relishes in continuing to embarrass itself through use of unpopular and outdated methods to silence dissent.

He said, “I wonder when this administration will learn to put across it’s response to criticisms raised concerning it’s record or patriotically yield to superior arguments rather than perpetually taking away the right to liberty as an avenue for stifling dissent.” Obayuwana said that reports from the trial of Sowore so far did not show that his call for a revolution was tantamount to a call for violence.

It certainly is not acceptable for the Buhari government to constitute itself into a cog in the wheel of progress in Nigeria, employing outdated and discredited tactics of suppression of viewpoints. We insist that Sowore be freed now,” he said. SHOCKING! DOCTORS ARE MESMERIZED BY THIS NATURAL PREMATURE EJACULATION AND SMALL SIZE SOLUTION GUARANTEED TO BULLDOZE YOUR WOMAN INTO SEXUAL SUBMISSION
