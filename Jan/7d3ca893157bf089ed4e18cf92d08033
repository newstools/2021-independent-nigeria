The fans should sup­port the team even if they are not inside the stadium because their support, prayers and belief matters so much at this time,” he said. Speaking similarly, Vic­tor Mbaoma, another star in the rank of the Peoples Elephants, said that in­stead of being pessimistic on the chances of the eight times Nigerian champions to overcome the hurdle, it was imperative that the fans believe in the team at this time, thanking them for all their supports these years. “We lost 3-0 and it is right for fans to feel down, but I think they should show why they are Eny­imba fans at this period instead of showing pessi­mism. They have been the backbone of this team and they should not abandon us at this time we need their prayers most,” he said. SHOCKING!
