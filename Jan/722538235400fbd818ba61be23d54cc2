The Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC) has stressed the need to end the practice of estimated billing by electricity distribution companies (Discos) in the country. Mr. Dafe Akpeneya , NERC’s commissioner responsible for legal, licencing and compliance, stated that the regulations on estimated billing was originally designed for customers without meters. He added that overtime the method became the primary complaint of customers, including those with post-paid meters and as such threatened the value chain.

According to him, with the method in practice, a lot of customers were unwilling to pay the estimated bills sent to them by Discos. “The new capping order was introduced to create parity between metered and unmetered customers. Ultimately, the endgame is still to meter all customers, in the shortest possible time,” an excerpt from the roundtable quoted Akpeneye to have said.

It noted in the order that all unmetered residential customers who consume more than 50 kilowatt per hour of electricity in a month and small businesses customers should not be invoiced for the consumption of energy beyond the cap it stipulated. But the Discos complained that the cap on estimated bills do not reflect the amount of energy consumed by these unmetered customers, and that NERC’s assumptions were inaccurate.
