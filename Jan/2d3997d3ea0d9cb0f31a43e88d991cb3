It is also believed that the country is using such diplomatic moves to restore global confidence and assuage world sentiments in the wake of Western media onslaught over its allegedculpability in the outbreak of the deadly Corona-Virus that has killed more than 200,000 people worldwide. The West especially the United States, Italy, France, the UK, are some of the worse hit countries with average death from the disease placed above 1000 persons. Corona-Virus was traced to a wet-market in Wuhan, China, where live and dead wild animals that people ate for food, improved health and for other purposes were sold. Even after the discovery of a vaccine for it’s cure, the virus has since mutated into a new variant which many fear may resist the globally accepted Pfizer-made vaccine. In November 2020, China slammed trade restrictions of over $19 billion a year on Australia following calls by the Australian Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, for an international inquiry into the source of the Covid-19 outbreak. In May 2020, China had threatened to sanction U.S. lawmakers who were particularly critical of its response to the Corona-Virus pandemic. A move experts said was unprecedented as Beijing pushes back on international condemnation about its handling of the virus’ spread. SHOCKING!
