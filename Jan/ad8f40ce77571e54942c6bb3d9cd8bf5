He regretted that motorcycle operators were migrating to rural communities to cause mayhem and urged security agents to intensify surveillance in the hinterland. Speaking specifically on the ban on the use of motorcycles in Sankera area, he said it was necessitated by the persistent attacks on residents of Ukum and Katsina- Ala which led to many deaths. “The ban is 100 percent successful,” he declared.
