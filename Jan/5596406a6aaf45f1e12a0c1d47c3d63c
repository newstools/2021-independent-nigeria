LAGOS – Prominent Nigerian Prophet TB Joshua has given a mes­sage regarding what to expect for the New Year 2021. The cleric, who sent the message from a ‘Prayer Mountain’ at an undisclosed location in Nigeria, stopped short of releasing his ‘full prophecy’ for the year but hinted that multiple challeng­es lay ahead. “This year is planting a seed that will be harvested next ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY.

Specifically addressing the coronavirus pandemic that ravaged the world through­out 2020, the cleric stated the disease “has three stages”. “We are getting to the end of the first stage. The second stage will be tougher than the first stage but it will not affect all countries,” he continued, adding that the “third stage will be tougher than the sec­ond stage” but not as “wide­spread” as the initial outbreak. Joshua then released some items he termed “faith tools” which he insisted would pro­vide “a cure”. “This is why the Lord gave me these faith tools – the New Anointing Water and the New Anointing Sticker, tagged “Not Mine But God’s Own,” Joshua explained, holding up a sticker and a small bottle of packaged water. “Why the choice of water instead of oil? It is because it can be applied on any part of the body. It is not for sale; that is why it is anointed. Don’t be deceived due to desperation. Don’t forget – ignorance is a sin,” the cleric counselled. Joshua added the world needed a sign to show these faith tools “came from God” because “we no longer trust our neighbours and our neigh­bours no longer trust us”. He proceeded to show a clip of the ‘New Anointing Water’ being ministered virtually to people with various health challenges from over twenty different countries who con­nected to an online prayer ses­sion through Emmanuel TV. As the water was minis­tered to the screen, several people involuntarily fell to the floor and testified thereafter to an instant miraculous healing. Joshua concluded by say­ing he needed to get clear un­derstanding from God before declaring his complete pro­phetic message for 2021. SHOCKING!
