The second baby of the year, a boy, was born to the family of Mr and Mrs Olukole Faluyi at the Methodist Health Centre in Ikole-Ekiti. He weighed 3.4 kg. Delivering the First Lady’s message, Ogunlade called on pregnant women in the state to always patronise government health facilities for safe delivery. “The government’s efforts in the prevention of maternal and infant mortality rate would be difficult to achieve if expectant mothers do not patronise modern facilities at already established health centres,’’ she noted. She said, “Development cannot thrive in an atmosphere where there is no peace. Hence the need for mothers to give quality attention and priority to the well-being of their children.” The Ado Local Government Chairman, Mrs Omotunde Fajuyi and her counterpart from Ikole Local Government, Mr Sola Olominu, received the delegation at the hospitals. They thanked the First Lady’s representatives for their visit and appealed to parents in the state to ensure good upbringing of their wards. The babies’ parents appreciated the gesture of the governor’s wife, saying that the items presented would go a long way in caring for their babies. (NAN) SHOCKING!
