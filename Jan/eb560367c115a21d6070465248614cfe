The Prominent Civil Rights Advocacy group-: Human Rights Writers Association of Nigeria (HURIWA) has condemned the move by some lawmakers to amend the Electoral Act to allow for un­der-age girls who are married to vote, saying that it will write to the European Union and the United Kingdom to probe some of the legislators for pos­sible links to paedophilia. “We are definitely going to send powerful letters to mem­ber nations of the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Australia and Canada to call their attention to the possi­bility of a network of paedo­philes in the current National Assembly of Nigeria. “We will be asking these de­veloped societies to take steps to impose travel restrictions against these identified mem­bers of the National Assembly who may actually be running a network and a gang of Pae­dophiles.”
