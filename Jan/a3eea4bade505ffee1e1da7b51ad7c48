P/HARCOURT  – Piqued by their callous activities, some youths from Bonny Local Government Area of Rivers state on Thursday converged at the main gate leading to Rivers State Government House in Port Harcourt to protest against incessant attacks on boat passengers by sea pirates on the community’s waterways. For centuries, the people of Bonny Island have not accessed their homes by road except through the creeks and sea, which join the community with other parts of the state. The youths have been embarking on peaceful protests in Bonny Island but they decided to storm Port Harcourt to make their case before the state governor.
