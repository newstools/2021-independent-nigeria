However, data for the last four months of the year showed a rapid increase in the figure of new registrations as the enrolments increased by at least one million in two months. Between August 17 and October 18, one million new registrations were recorded by the banks, this was surpassed in the October 19 to December 27 record. Industry analysts said the recent increase may not be unconnected with a series of government schemes aiming at empowering the people, for which BVN numbers are required. The Minister of State for Labour and Employment, Festus Keyamo, for instance, recently announced that six Nigerian banks had been engaged to commence account opening with BVN for the 774,000 participants of the Special Public Works Programme in their branches, through-out the 774 local governments. Similarly, several other schemes of the government targeting SMEs require them to supply their BVN for disbursement of funds. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), in collaboration with the Bankers’ Committee, NIBSS, and the German firm, Dermalog, launched the $50 million BVN project, on February 14, 2014, with the aim of capturing biometrics of all bank customers and giving them a unique identity that can be verified across the Nigerian banking industry. The project is also aimed at deepening financial inclusion in the country. To have many more Nigerians on the BVN database, the CBN had in December 2019 announced the commencement of classification BVN 2.0 plan that allows both the rich and poor in rural areas to access financial services.
