A chieftain of the All Pro­gressives Congress (APC) from Ebonyi State, Senator Anthony Agbo has called on the Federal Government, through the Federal Minis­try of Works, to standard­ize its road construction by adopting the Ebonyi State pattern as a national model. Agbo stated that this had become not only necessary but also imperative and of urgent national importance due to the huge financial re­sources that are perennially sunk into road works in the country. He said the Federal Gov­ernment only ended up achieving roads that compre­hensively collapsed within a few years of construction. ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY. DON'T BE A VICTIM! The Senator, who repre­sented Ebonyi North Senato­rial District during the sixth Senate, averred that the gov­ernor of Ebonyi State, David Umahi, had introduced a new and a revolutionary con­cept in construction work in Nigeria. He said the governor came up with the idea of concrete roads, which has become the standard and indeed very successful road construction model for Ebo­nyi State.
