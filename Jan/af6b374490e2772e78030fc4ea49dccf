Mr Modi spoke at length about doctors, nurses and other front-line workers “who showed us the light” in “dark times”. “They stayed away from their families to serve humanity. And hundreds of them never went home. They gave their life to save others. And that is why the first jabs are being given to healthcare workers – this is our way of paying respect to them.” (SOURCE: BBC)
