On Facebook, authorities in Massachusetts are determined to find the origins of a llama found wandering loose in a field. According to Animal Control in Newburyport/west Newbury, they found the llama wandering the field alone on Monday and witnesses said they don’t know where the animal came from. Animal control is asking the llama’s owner, or anyone with information on the animal’s owner, to contact officials for claims. While authorities’ investigation continues, the llama is currently at the Tiny Acres Farm in New Hampshire for temporary lodging.
