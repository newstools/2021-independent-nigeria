ABUJA – Association of Ikulu Professionals (AIP) has described as laughable attempts at linking Bishop Matthew Hassan Kukah’s Christmas homily to military coup. Describing the attempts as a deliberate act of misinter­preting his Christmas homily, AIP said it was dumbfounded that some mischief makers had erroneously interpreted the Bishop’s sermon as calling for a military coup. Miffed at the deliberate attempts by some persons and organisations at misin­terpreting the content of the cleric’s message, the group, in a statement by its Secretary, Dr. Paul H. Mamman, noted the unjustifiable attacks and varied responses on the mes­sage.

DON'T BE A VICTIM! “For those who are ac­quainted with the footprints of Bishop Kukah, the spuri­ous attempts at linking his message to military coup is not only laughable but also a deliberate act of misinterpret­ing his Christmas homily. “This is not the first time the erudite Catholic Bishop is calling out against the failings of government and appealing to citizens to embrace hope amidst the dark clouds of frightening despair. For Bish­op Kukah, speaking truth to power has always been a con­sistent trait in his character,” AIP said.
