LAGOS – Pastor Enoch Adeboye, the general overseer of the Re­deemed Christian Church of God ( RCCG), on Sunday disclosed the reason why the church cancelled the much anticipated cross-over ser­vice that usually takes place at the Redemption camp and various parishes all over the world, saying it’s was can­celed in order to obey the government. The General Overseer said that it is important that the church obey the rules laid down by the government who earlier said all churches must close before 12.pm hence the cancellation of the night ser­vice. Adeboye made the as­sertion during RCCG’s first thanksgiving of the year held at the church’s headquarters in Ebute-meta, Lagos.

He however noted that the watch-night service was done virtually because it sounds odd to hold and end a service known as cross-over by 10pm. “It also sound funny when they said churches should close early. I found it funny because nobody told us that coronavirus attacks at night. We never knew that the virus is a witch that operates only at night.

Adeboye, however added that the government are try­ing their best in curbing the virus and because they are human, that are bound to make mistakes. “I am saying to you em­phatically that the govern­ment are trying and putting in their very best, though they did some funny things during the process. “It also sounds funny that they close restaurants but local food vendors were left open to still sell food, when I heard , I knew it was funny because it is the rich people that goes there.
