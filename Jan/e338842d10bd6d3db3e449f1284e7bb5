West Bromwich Albion recorded their first win under Sam Allardyce as they beat Wolverhampton Wanderers 3-2 in a see-saw Black Country derby in the Premier League on Saturday, with Matheus Pereira scoring twice from the spot. West Brom opened the scoring when centre back Willy Boly, back from injury, fouled Callum Robinson in the seventh minute on the edge of the box, and Pereira stepped up to convert the penalty, sending Wolves keeper Rui Patricio the wrong way. Boly made amends towards the end of the first half when his back-heeled pass in the box freed up Fabio Silva, who side-footed the ball past David Button for the 18-year-old’s first goal at home.

Minutes later, Boly made it 2-1 when the ball fell to him during a corner kick, leaving Button no chance to make a save as the defender scored from six yards out. West Brom turned things around with two quick-fire goals after the restart, the first from a long throw-in when Kyle Bartley’s flicked header allowed Semi Ajayi to loop his header past Patricio.
