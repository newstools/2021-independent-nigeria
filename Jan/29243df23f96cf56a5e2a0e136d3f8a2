The Nigeria Police Force (NPF) is set to collaborate with Premier Agribusiness Academy (PAA) on training of officers as part of preparation towards retirement. Toromade Francis, Director General of the Academy while speaking shortly after a collaboration meeting at the Force Headquarters in Abuja, said that once all the modalities for the partnership has been concluded, the Academy will train officers on all aspects of agribusiness including poultry, agronomy and aquaculture. AIG Aishatu Abubakar stated that the training is necessary to adequately prepare and equip police officers who are willing to engage in farming activities after their retirement.

She added that, without proper training, officers may struggle to succeed in the trade or could be swindled as they do not have prior knowledge or understanding of agribusiness. Abubakar stressed that the initiative is in line with the vision of the Inspector General of Police (IGP) Mohammed Adamu, who recently inaugurated the maiden Nigeria Police Force Pre-retirement Farming and Skill Acquisition Centre at Kudan, Kaduna State to prepare police officers for a better life after retirement.
