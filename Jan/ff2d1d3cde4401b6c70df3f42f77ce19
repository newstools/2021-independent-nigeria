LAGOS – Speaker of the Lagos State House of Assembly, Mu­dashiru Obasa, has named the Nigeria Security and Civ­il Defence Corps (NSCDC), as well as journalists as major stakeholders in the develop­ment of the country. Obasa made this position known late on Tuesday when the two organisations paid him separate visits in his of­fice at the Assembly Complex, Alausa, Ikeja. Speaking when he received the NSCDC officers led by the Commandant in Lagos, Ayeni Paul Kolawole, the Speaker said the security agency is as important as the government that established it.

The Speaker urged the security body to remain dedi­cated in their service to Lagos state and the country. He also tasked the person­nel of the agency to constant­ly endear themselves to the residents of the state and the country while approaching their duties with human face.

Earlier, Commandant Ayeni had pledged the agen­cy’s commitment to the peace of the state, adding that the Lagos government had been of immense assistance to the security organisation. He, however, appealed that the body be considered in rela­tion to the laws of Lagos. Meanwhile, Obasa has described journalism as an integral part of a country’s success.
