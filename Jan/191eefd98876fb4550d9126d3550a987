GOMBE – A cross section of religious and traditional leaders, as well as heads of media or­ganisations in Gombe State have pledged their unalloyed support in pursuing the course for the domestication of Violence Against Persons Prohibition (VAPP) law. According to a recent report by the Gombe State office of the National Human Rights Com­mission (NHRC), Gombe State records one of the highest rates of sexual based violence, espe­cially against female minors. However, during a one day stakeholders’ engagement with the head of media or­ganizations, as well as tradi­tional and religious leaders, organised by Gombe State VAPP Alliance, the stakehold­ers were unanimous in calling for a speedy domestication and passage of the VAPP Law in the state to check the rising embarrassing trend.
