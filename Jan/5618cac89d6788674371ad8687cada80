Oil prices fell on Tuesday over uncertainties due to the adjournment of the OPEC+ group meeting in which differences arose among member countries in their agreement of a production cut quota for February. International benchmark Brent crude was trading at $50.84 per barrel at 0634 GMT, and compared to Monday, marked a decrease of 0.49% after closing at $51.09 a barrel. American benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was at $47.45 per barrel at the same time for a 0.36% decrease after it ended the previous session at $47.62 a barrel.

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies, including Russia, a group known as OPEC+, failed to agree at Monday’s meeting on whether to keep the current 7.2 million barrels per day production level or increase the quota.
