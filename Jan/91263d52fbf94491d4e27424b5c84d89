Following the recent revital­ization of Borno Plastic Com­pany by Governor Babagana Umara Zulum, the National Agricultural Land Develop­ment Authority (NALDA), has placed an order for pro­duction of two million pieces of 50kg capacity plastic sacks. NALDA’s Executive Sec­retary, Prince Paul Ikonne announced the partnership on Tuesday in Maiduguri when he led Directors of the Authority on a courtesy call on Governor Zulum. “We have seen what you (Zulum) is doing, we have seen your factories and I want to inform you that in one of your factories, the sack manufacturing factory, NAL­DA is placing an order for 2 million sacks for packaging purposes in nationwide food programme in which Borno has been selected as one of the pilot states. ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY. DON'T BE A VICTIM! Mr. Ikonne also assured that NALDA will continue to patronize products from Borno’s Plastic Company to promote local content. The NALDA boss also informed Governor Zulum that his visit was on Presi­dent Buhari’s directive with a mandate to reactivate all of NALDA’s farm estates aban­doned in different parts of Nigeria.
