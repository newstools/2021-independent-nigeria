The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) on Saturday described as a triumph of justice, the Federal High Court, Abuja, ruling on the alleged certificate forgery case against the Edo State governor, Godwin Obaseki. The court had on Saturday morning dismissed the case filed by the All Progressives Congress (APC) against the governor for lack of merit. Justice Ahmed Mohammed, who delivered judgment in the case, said APC could not prove its claim that Obaseki forged his academic certificates submitted to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) before the September 19, 2019 governorship election in the state.

It urged the governor to continue in his selfless service to the people of Edo State.
