WASHINGTON — President Trump awarded the National Medal of Arts to country music singers Toby Keith and Ricky Skaggs minutes after he was impeached for the second time on Wednesday afternoon, a White House spokesperson confirmed. Skaggs, 61, is an American country and bluegrass singer who has won the Grammy Award 15 times while Keith, 59, performed at a pre-inauguration celebration for Trump in Washington, D.C. in 2016. The National Medal of Arts, created by Congress in 1984, is the highest honor given to artists and arts in the US.
