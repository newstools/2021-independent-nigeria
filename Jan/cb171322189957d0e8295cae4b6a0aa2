Zambian President Edgar Lungu on Monday called on technocrats in the water sector to come up with technologies that will help in harvesting rain water. While acknowledging the good rains the country continues enjoying during the rainy season, the Zambian leader expressed concern that the country lacked technology on how to harness the water for both domestic and industrial use. “It is time we learned how to harvest rain for the good of our people because we do not have rainfall throughout the year,” he said when he swore-in newly-appointed Minister of Water Development, Sanitation and Environmental Protection Raphael Nakachinda.
