The Association of Nigerian Chartered Architects (ANCA), suggested development models for Nigeria to bridge the widening gap in the nation’s housing sector. The models, according to ANCA include State Budgetary Finance Commitments (SBFC), Designated Consolidated Housing Fund (DCHF); and Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN). The chartered architects also suggested leveraging on Private Mortgage Institutions (PMI); group formations for crowd-funding, CDAs/Unions/Cooperative; REIT, Public-Private Partnership (PPP) financing among others, with the government’s intervention through attractive incentives as a social responsibility and her objective performance of the transitory interplay of roles as provider, enabler, facilitator and regulator to engender trust, confidence and interest of investors.

These development models, according to ANCA, will provide inherent abilities to be off-taker/up-taker driven in terms of adequacy in quality, acceptability, geopolitical or cultural idiosyncrasies and socio-economic capabilities on an agreeable and reasonable periodic equity contribution or repayment regime for mortgage or rentals or rent-to-own or build-to-own of the housing units. Such programmes, ANCA added will engender equitable development and investments in affordable and social housing projects, which is in line with the New Urban Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG); specifically goal 11: Making Cities and Human Settlements Safe, Inclusive, Resilient and Sustainable.
