BENIN – Osagie Ize-Iyamu, Edo State All Progressives Congress (APC) governorship candidate in the September 19, 2020 gubernatorial poll has appealed the judgement of the lower court that nullified the candidacy of his running mate, Audu Ganiyu. Ize-Iyamu appealed the judgement on the basis that the trial judge erred in law when he held that the suit between Kadiri Oshoakhemhe (First respondent) against Audu Ganiyu (second respondent) and others was not statute-barred by virtue of the provisions of the 1999 constitution (as amended). The APC governorship candidate asked the court to set aside the judgement of the trial court and dismiss the first respondent for failing to prove his claim rooted in allegation of commission of crime beyond reasonable doubt as required by law. ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY. DON'T BE A VICTIM! Recall that on Wednesday the Edo State high court nullified Ganiyu’s candidacy for giving false information to the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) in the form EC9 to enable him contest the governorship election in the State. The trial judge delivered judgement in a suit No: B/358/2020, filed by Kadiri Oshoakhemhe against the APC deputy governorship candidate and others.
