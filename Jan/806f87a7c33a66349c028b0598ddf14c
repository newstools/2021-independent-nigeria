UGHELLI – HRM, Godspower Oporomo, the Taraeza 1 of Kerebi­ri-Mein kingdom in Bomadi Local Government Area of Delta State, has appealed to the state government to do justice and remove them from ungodly oppression and expeditiously recognise the kingdom. The Delta monarch called on Okowa to address issues causing the delay in the pre­sentation of staff of office to him, also charging him to look into the abandoned Bomadi Polytechnic project that was passed by the state House of Assembly and the unfulfilled aged-long promise of government to link Boma­di and its environ to national grid. The Taraeza 1 said this in an address during the occa­sion to mark his fourth coro­nation anniversary at his pal­ace playground Bomadi, also urging the state governor to consider politicians from his domain vital for appreciable political appointments.
