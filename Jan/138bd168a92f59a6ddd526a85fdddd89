The Nigeria Football Fed­eration (NFF) have asked the Confederation of Afri­can Football (CAF) to post­pone and possibly relocate the Confederation Cup first round second leg involving Nigerian club Rivers Unit­ed and Bloemfontein Celtic of South Africa. The NFF said the request followed the refusal of the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to step down on some of the Covid-19 pro­tocols such as the quarantine period for the South African contingent. In its letter on Monday, the NFF asked for the “postpone­ment of the game and a pos­sible rescheduling of both the date and venue of the match, with the possibility of stag­ing the match in any Nigeria neigbouring countries with a little less stringent Covid-19 protocols.” ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY. DON'T BE A VICTIM! South Africa is the source of a new variant of the coro­navirus, which is far more transmissible than the origi­nal strain. The tie is scheduled for Wednesday in the southern Nigerian city of Port Har­court. Rivers United won the first leg 2-0 in South Africa a fortnight ago.
