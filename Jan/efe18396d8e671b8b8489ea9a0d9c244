IBADAN- The Oyo State Government has extended the deadline of the application for Certificate of Occupancy under the Oyo Home Owners Charter Scheme by six months. The Commissioner for Lands, Housing and Urban Development, Barrister Abiodun Abdu-Raheem in a release issued on Monday at Ibadan, said the extension of the deadline was due to the clamour by property owners for more time in order to apply for the C of O under the OYHOC Scheme. According to Barrister Abiodun, the window period for the application of the OYHOC was supposed to end in December 2020, this brought about a lot of traffic last year December, whereby a lot of applicants paid the required processing fee.

He noted that a lot of applicants who could not process their C of O clamoured for more time and since the Seyi Makinde led administration is a listening government and as part of palliative to the people, the State government decided to give more time for the applicants to have their title documents processed. ‘The process of the Certificate of Occupancy under the OYHOC is still on, the state government has listened to the plight of people who demanded for more time for the application.” No Qualified Nigerian Should Be Barred From Contesting In 2023 –Ajomale Ohanaeze Ndigbo And The Challenges Before Obiozor “I urge people to take advantage of this period to buy the scratch card and pay the required amount of processing fee so as to have their property registered under the OYHOC Scheme”, Abiodun urged.
