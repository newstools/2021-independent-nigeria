The call for appointees resignations followed Trump’s statement early Thursday that there would be an orderly transfer of power come January 20. Before now the White House had refused to issue the call for resignations since November 2020 when Biden was confirmed winner of the presidential election. Every outgoing administration in the US is expected to issue the order between Election Day and mid-December. In Trump’s case, White House officials declined to request the resignations because Trump rejected Biden’s victory and file a flury of court cases challenging the voting results in the courts.
