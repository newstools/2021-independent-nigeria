The NCF official added that the mandatory online registration also affected the number of entries received. “Sometimes due to internet issues, the documents of players may not be updated as soon as possible, but we expect that before the deadline, everyone will be captured,” he declared. Oriss also said preparations were on top gear ahead of the two-day competition to commence Saturday, Jan. 16 “The competition is going to be played at the zonal level. “States within the zones are going to converge at a location and play against each other with a winner emerging thereafter. “So, states have started traveling to their various locations for the tournament,” he said.
