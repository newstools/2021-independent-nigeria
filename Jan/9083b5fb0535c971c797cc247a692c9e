Amazon has become the latest tech company to ban Parler, an alternative social media platform used by the alt-right and Donald Trump supporters who stormed Congress. In an announcement on Saturday, Amazon said Parler would be removed by midnight on Sunday (Pacific Standard Time), and that the app should use another web-hosting service. The move means Parler’s website, which is hosted by Amazon, will shut down unless the platform relocates to another web-host. The app would also then become unusable, CNN reported.

Parler, whose users include conspiracy theorists, right-wing extremists, and Trump supporters, has also received bans by Apple and Google since Wednesday’s riots. America’s tech companies argue that Parler broke service terms, while commentators have said the app promoted violence that was seen when the US president’s supporters rioted on the Capitol.
