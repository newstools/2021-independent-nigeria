LAGOS – The World Bank has stated that commitment to good governance will improve integrity from the risks of weak legal and regulatory frameworks, corporate governance weaknesses, and lack of transparency and disclosure of finances that arise in State Owned Enterprises (SOEs), as well as limited effective government and citizen oversight. It stated this in a recently report titled, ‘Enhancing Government Effectiveness and Transparency: The Fight against Corruption’, adding that SOEs are generally regarded as corporations created by a government to participate in commercial activities on its behalf. In the report, the World Bank stated that corruption in SOEs has gained prominence in recent years due to high-profile scandals in countries like Brazil, South Africa, Angola, and Malaysia.

The bank explained that corruption risks in SOEs arise from various sources such as monopoly or quasi-monopoly rights which provide an opportunity for abnormal profit generation. According to the bank, corrupt acts committed in SOEs with these shortcomings have defining effects on the economies of countries and government’s abilities to provide critical public goods and services.

The bank thus suggested that, “opening up markets to greater competition to reduce monopoly power and market share and incentivise financial and fiscal discipline, strengthening SOE legal and regulatory frameworks and practices, building a commitment to good governance and capacity of state-owned entities,” could help improve integrity in the SOEs. It also proposed that, “professionalising the SOE board of directors and senior management, establishing effective internal controls, compliance, and risk management, promoting transparency and full financial disclosure, including of SOE debt,” are other measures that could cut down corruption in SOEs. The World Bank warned that, “Reforming governance of SOEs alone may not always be enough to prevent corruption and assure efficiency,” adding that breaking large SOEs into smaller units for greater efficiency could be adopted as well.
