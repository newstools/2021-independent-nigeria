He said that the high rate of impatience among motorists had led to lane indiscipline and driving against traffic, thus compounding the traffic situation in some major road corridors in the South-East zone. “Motorists must learn how to exercise patience and accommodate other road users. This is what is required on our roads today. Motorists should realise that only the living celebrates and that the dead will never come home to celebrate.” SHOCKING!
