Arsenal are now interested in signing Steven Nzonzi, with his contract at Roma set to expire, Foot Mercato have reported. Arsenal are eager to strengthen over the January transfer window, and N’Zonzi has now emerged as a potential bargain target. The defensive midfielder may be 32 now, but he could add depth to Arsenal’s options and provide them with more steel.

With Thomas Partey already at the club, Nzonzi would surely only be brought in as back-up.
