On Wednesday pro-Trump protestors in Washington D.C. stormed Capitol Hill in an act of violence stoked by the president, who has continued peddling election conspiracy theories. Wednesday marked the certification of president-elect Joe Biden’s victory by Congress—an ordinary process that, like all things under Donald Trump, has deteriorated into a volatile and uncertain endeavour. Vice President Mike Pence was quickly evacuated by security while the rest of the Senate members were locked in their chambers. The cene on the ground was chaos as Senator Mitt Romney reportedly yelled, “This is what you’ve gotten,” to his colleagues including Ted Cruz, who has been a vocal supporter of Trump illegitimate crusade. According to Igor Bobic, a reporter for Huffpost, protestors were outside the Senate chamber while others were pacing the halls screaming, “Where the fuck are they?” The president, meanwhile, issued an unprecedented tweet urging his supporters to remain peaceful.
