OSOGBO – The Osun State govern­ment has intensified ef­forts on the advocacy for taking precautions against Covid-19 pandemic. This is as the market leaders expressed their support for the Governor Gboyega Oyetola’s candi­dature for a second term. It would be recalled that the Osun State Government in last couple of weeks, had through its Civic Engage­ment arm, launched a mar­ket rally in a bid to sensitise the residents of the state on Covid-19 pandemic.
