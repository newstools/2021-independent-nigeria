Eze, who represented Enugu North Senatorial Zone in the Senate, maintained that he remains strongly a member of the party and would work for its growth. “We need strong people to win elections; we need to go and canvas for membership; I don’t deter, I am very strongly in APC and I am going to work for APC to see us achieve results. If you see us doing anything, we are trying to build bridges and trying to reach across because it is not a job that one person can do. “I have consistently been fighting for the party, even when we didn’t win the election, I was here to thank you that we did our best. “There has been a lot of challenges, a lot of struggles but between the chairman, Ben Nwoye, Emma Eneukwu and a few others, we have been able to weather the storm. “This is a party to watch but we are not handling it as a party to watch; even the other political parties, they look on us with a lot of respect; but I don’t think that we look at ourselves with that amount of respect, we are fighting ourselves; we are calling parallel meetings, let us resolve in this new year to all pull in one direction. “We need to be hungry for power and let that hunger drive us into being one another’s keeper. If we unite behind our chairman and the executive there is nothing we put our mind that we cannot achieve.https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/ads?guci=2.2.0.0.2.2.0.0&gdpr=0&client=ca-pub-5089981496810613&output=html&h=343&slotname=5364422452&adk=1394730730&adf=3125041455&pi=t.ma~as.5364422452&w=412&lmt=1609693179&rafmt=1&psa=1&format=412×343&url=https%3A%2F%2Fthenationonlineng.net%2Fapc-to-win-enugu-in-2023-says-senator-eze%2F&flash=0&fwr=1&fwrattr=true&rpe=1&resp_fmts=3&sfro=1&wgl=1&tt_state=W3siaXNzdWVyT3JpZ2luIjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9hZHNlcnZpY2UuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbSIsInN0YXRlIjowfSx7Imlzc3Vlck9yaWdpbiI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXR0ZXN0YXRpb24uYW5kcm9pZC5jb20iLCJzdGF0ZSI6MH1d&dt=1609693311401&bpp=12&bdt=3791&idt=2927&shv=r20201203&cbv=r20190131&ptt=9&saldr=aa&abxe=1&cookie=ID%3D062c4685d940d5be%3AT%3D1609688939%3AS%3DALNI_MajeFQQfUZaGs-XNYFXpAERi6CzEQ&prev_fmts=300×250%2C412x343%2C412x343&correlator=1493947792267&frm=20&pv=1&ga_vid=1150738335.1571592760&ga_sid=1609693316&ga_hid=123767603&ga_fc=0&u_tz=60&u_his=2&u_java=0&u_h=869&u_w=412&u_ah=869&u_aw=412&u_cd=24&u_nplug=0&u_nmime=0&adx=0&ady=3859&biw=412&bih=731&scr_x=0&scr_y=0&eid=42530672%2C21068945%2C21066819%2C21066973&oid=3&pvsid=1023213409653483&pem=19&ref=https%3A%2F%2Fc.newsnow.co.uk%2F&rx=0&eae=0&fc=900&brdim=0%2C0%2C0%2C0%2C412%2C0%2C412%2C731%2C412%2C731&vis=1&rsz=%7C%7CEebr%7C&abl=CS&pfx=0&fu=8320&bc=31&ifi=4&uci=a!4&btvi=3&fsb=1&xpc=Rv7CPO5e2D&p=https%3A//thenationonlineng.net&dtd=4261 “I came this new year to thank you for the services you are rendering to the party, it is a thankless job and it is worse in APC than in other parties. This is a mother that abandons its children; people who get rewarded in the party are not people who work; so they leave members and reward people from nowhere. That is why I commend the acting national chairman, because he said he wants to change the reward system of the party.” Senator Eze added that the Nigeria President of Igbo extraction was possible with the commitment of members from this geo-political zone. “Igbo presidency, we need to work for it, it will not just drop from the roof; we have to work for it and it means building alliances, building friends, because it is not something that we here can do alone. So, let us not try to be cagy and shut our doors. I believe that if we work conscientiously, there is something that I see in the horizon coming for this party, but the key is unity,” he stated.
