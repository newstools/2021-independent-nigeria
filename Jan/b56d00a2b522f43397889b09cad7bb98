Filip Krovinovic is set to leave West Bromwich Albion halfway through his second loan spell at the club. Former Baggies boss Slaven Bilic worked hard to bring the Croatian playmaker back to The Hawthorns after his hand in last season’s promotion to the Premier League. Krovinovic made 40 appearances in the Championship under Bilic and described his return from Benfica in the summer as “like coming back to school after the summer holidays.”But he has failed to make an impact in the top-flight and the Telegraph reports the 25-year-old’s stay at Albion will be cut short with the approval of Sam Allardyce before he returns to Croatia to sign for Hajduk Split. ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY. DON'T BE A VICTIM! His last appearance came in last week’s FA Cup third round defeat to Blackpool on penalties. On Thursday, Albion goalkeeper Jonathan Bond completed a move to MLS outfit LA Galaxy. Zidane Urges Fans To Be Patient With Eden Hazard Real Madrid Send Luka Jovic To Frankfurt On Loan Bond was permitted a permanent departure to bring to an end a two-and-a-half year spell with the club, during which time he made seven appearances – all of them in cup competitions. Even those opportunities dried up this season, though, after the arrival of David Button nudged him down to become the third choice keeper at the club. After Albion secured the short-term signing of Andy Lonergan, who joins Button and first choice Sam Johnstone in completing Albion’s new look keeping department, Bond was allowed to leave for the US.
