Secretary of State Mike Pompeo told The Epoch Times’ Jan Jekielek that the Chinese Communist Party’s influence is now inside the American government, research institutions, and schools. He said: “President Trump recognized that when he began his campaign and then when he took office. We’ve now changed fundamentally how I think the West looks at China, not just the United States. Even when you look at Europe, Australia, and South East Asia, they know too. They know that the Chinese Communist Party is up to no good.” “The true face of the Chinese Communist Party has been exposed.”
