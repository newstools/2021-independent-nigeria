LAGOS  – Savannah Energy Plc has stated that it is optimistic about its performance next year and beyond. “We are looking forward to 2021 with excitement as we continue to work with our stakeholders to develop and grow our business for the benefit of all.”,Andrew Knott, CEO of Savannah Energy, said To strengthen such performance, the company has announced that its Accugas subsidiary has entered into a revised gas sales agreement (“GSA”) on favourable terms with Lafarge Africa PLC, part of the LafargeHolcim Group, for the supply of gas to its Mfamosing cement plant in Cross River State, Nigeria.

The revised GSA sees the contract term with Lafarge extended for a further five years to January 2037, giving a remaining contract life of 17 years. The new agreement also allows for an increase in the gas sales price from 2027, with additional US-Consumer Price Index indexation from 1 January 2029. The revised GSA has a reduction in the daily contracted quantity (“DCQ”) of gas from 38.7 MMscfpd to 24.2 MMscfpd. This reduction in the DCQ will allow Accugas to release approximately 12 MMscfpd of currently reserved gas processing capacity at the CPF, enabling Accugas to enter into additional long-term GSAs for these volumes, which will increase the business’ future revenues and cashflow potential.

This revised structure also allows Lafarge to utilise its accumulated make-up gas balance of approximately US$58 million, whilst we have preserved the capacity to supply higher volumes when these are required by Lafarge. Lafarge’s commitments under the revised GSA will continue to be guaranteed by an international investment grade bank guarantee. SHOCKING!
