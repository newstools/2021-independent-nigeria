Three of the suspects were also paraded. According to Garba, among the 60 suspects arrested in the previous year, 44 of them were convicted of the crime at the Federal High Court, while others were still going through court processes. According to the statistics reeled out by the Commander, six drug cases were recorded each in January and February 2020, four in March, May; two, June; three, July; two, August; one, September; five, October and November recorded seven cases each, while December had five cases.

In all, there were 48 seizure cases in 2020, while the period also recorded three abandoned seizures. Furthermore, the total seizures and arrests made in 2020 were lower than that of 2019, the statistics revealed.

According to him, Okeke was a second-time drug offender and also a fugitive wanted by the Federal High Court for jumping bail for a drug-related offence in 2014. He also mentioned Azubuike Jeremiah Emeka who was arrested on January 8, 2021, with 7.8kg of cocaine “neatly concealed in embroidery (tailoring) material.” Both suspects, he emphasised were apprehended during the inward clearance of passenger on Ethiopian Airlines from Brazil. The command also arrested one Abdul Musa a freight forwarder on January 8, 2021, with 117grams of cocaine destined for India at the Skyway Aviation Handling Company (SAHCO) Plc export cargo shed. According to him, the hard drug was wrapped and concealed in hair relaxer labelled “Ozone,” adding that Musa was on a bail for a similar offence before he was arrested. He added: These successes were achieved through the selfless sacrifice exhibited by the officers and men of the command, even in the face of the serious dangers and challenges. “I want to use this opportunity to thank the management of NDLEA for leading the command and partnering with United Kingdom border force, British National Crime Agency, which paved way for the creation of Joint Border Task Force Project (JBTF). A project responsible for the transformation of the NDLEA MMIA Command into a model office equipped with the state-of-the-art facilities and up to date training of officers in line with the international best practices.” However, all the suspects insisted that the luggage containing the drugs were given to them by friends who they couldn’t trace their locations. For instance, Azubuike who claimed to sell wares in Brazil claimed that a friend of his in Brazil gave him the luggage to give to his brother in Nigeria, stressing that he was not aware of the drugs until he was accosted by the officials of the NDLEA at the Lagos Airport. Also, Azeez Adebiyi, who was arrested with cocaine at the airport, said he was not a traveller, rather, assisted someone who was travelling to carry his luggage into the terminal. Unfortunately, the screening machines at the airport detected the drugs, while the drug courier escaped arrest. Uchenna, the third suspect who was a second-time drug offender, based in Brazil equally said he was not aware cocaine was planted in his luggage by a friend. According to him, he was able to secure another international passport at the Nigeria Immigration Service (NIS) after he claimed that his former passport was missing. He said he was promised some amount of money by the courier, one Chike, but regretted his involvement in the act.
