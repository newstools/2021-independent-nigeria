ONITSHA  – Commercial activities are gradually taking shape in the commercial city of Onitsha after the Yuletide season during which traders, artisans and other residents left for their various towns and villages to celebrate the festive season. Those who could not travel home to see their kiths and kin and attend to other family matters stayed behind awaiting resumption of business activities as many markets were shut for business at about 5:30 pm on 24th of December last year. However, major markets in Onitsha were open for business activities on the 4th day of January this year as directed by Anambra State Markets Amalgamated Traders Association (ASMATA) led by one Chief Ikechukwu Ekwegbalu.
