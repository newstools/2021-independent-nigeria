Chelsea midfielder Danny Drinkwater has joined Kasimpasa in Turkey on loan for the rest of the season. The midfielder has made just 23 appearances for the Blues since signing for the club from Leicester City in 2017 after winning the Premier League with the Foxes. It has been a troubled spell since making the £35million switch to the capital from the Midlands as Drinkwater suffered from a severe loss in form, a lack of matches and loan spells at both Burnley and Aston Villa that really didn’t pan out well for the midfielder.

Drinkwater hasn’t made a first team appearance for Chelsea in more than two years and is out of contract in west London at the end of the 2021/22 campaign. Chelsea are believed to be paying a substantial chunk of his wages while he heads abroad for the remainder of the 2020/21 campaign.

Bagudu Back in August 2019, Drinkwater joined Burnley club on loan until the following January and was forced to wait to make his league debut for the club until early December. His time with the Lancashire club had not gone how anyone had hoped for and he returned to west London in January before joining Aston Villa for the remainder of the campaign. His time at Villa Park, too, did not gone according to plan with the 30-year-old having made just four appearances for the club and getting into a scuffle with teammate Jota at their Bodymoor Heath training ground which summed up his spell at Villa Park. Drinkwater was restricted to under-23 appearances this season for Chelsea and hit the headlines again earlier this season when he was sent off for a fracas with Spurs teenager Alfie Devine.
