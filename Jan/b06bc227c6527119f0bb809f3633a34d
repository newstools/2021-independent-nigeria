YENAGOA – Bayelsa State Deputy Gov­ernor, Lawrence Ewhrud­jakpo, has implored in­mates at correctional centres across the country not to despair over their present situation, but rather have faith in God for their freedom. He gave the encourage­ment on New Year Day when he paid an unscheduled visit to the Medium Security Cus­todial Centre of the Nigerian Correctional Service at Okaka, Yenagoa, with Christmas and New Year gifts. Addressing the inmates, Ewhrudjakpo said he visited to celebrate the dawn of anoth­er year with them and encour­aged them not to give up on life.

In a statement by his Senior Special Assistant on Media, Doubara Atasi, the deputy governor urged the inmates to use the period of their stay in prison as a launch pad to greatness. He advised them to pray regularly, have faith in God and turn a new leaf so as to impact their environment positively when they were eventually released.

He said: “I have come here to felicitate with you. I felt the best way to appreciate God for what He has done is to come and be with you people. As you are here today, you are not here by mistake. God allowed you to come here to learn a lesson. “Some of you are here in­nocently, while some are genu­inely here. Whatever the case, where you are now, is to enable you vomit the unwanted food some of you ate. But, it is not yet over. So, keep hope alive. “I want to encourage you to take the good things you are being taught here serious­ly. A lot of people have come out from prisons and become great men and women. “This visit is like that of John the Baptist, the fore­runner. Some of you may be released when the governor visits you. But, you must try as much as you can to turn a new leaf because if a dog goes back to eat its vomit, then that dog is not fit to be a dog.” In their separate remarks, the State Comptroller of Ni­gerian Correctional Service, Bayelsa Command, Seth Edog­hotu and his deputy, Emeka Ogbuji, thanked the deputy governor for the visit, which they described as encourag­ing. According to them, the set of inmates he addressed were repentant and could contribute meaningfully to the growth and development of the state if released. SHOCKING!
