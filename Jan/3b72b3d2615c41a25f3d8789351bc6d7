OWERRI – The leadership of Ohanaeze Ndigbo, Imo State Chapter has announced indefinite suspension of 13 members of the organization for al­legedly violation some sec­tions of its constitution. The organization, which dismissed as false and mis­leading, recent media report of purported impeachment and vote of no confidence against its president, Dr. Eze­chi Chukwu, said that a dis­ciplinary committee would soon be set up to investigate the erring members, just as it re-affirmed its implicit confidence on Chukwu as an authentic representative of the state Ohanaeze values and aspirations. Ambassador Kenneth Nwachukwu, state secre­tary of the organization, who disclosed this while briefing newsmen in Ower­ri explained that only five, out of the 12 people who en­dorsed the purported “vote of no confidence petition” are authentic members of the executive committee of the body; stressing that the remaining 46 Exco members are solidly and firmly behind Chukwu’s leadership.

According to him, the in­nuendoes and insinuations of those disseminating the rumours of impeachment of Chukwu are merely opposed to the choice of a very renowned and highly respected son of the state- Professor George Obiozor, adding that Ohanaeze Ndig­bo in the state is holistically supportive of the candidacy of Ambassador Obiozor in conformity with the resolu­tion of the elders and leaders of the state. “This is an Imo Ohanaeze solemn resolution and it has nothing to do with Dr. Ezechi Chukwu as a person and our support for Obiozor is based on merit and the added val­ue his leadership portends compared with other equally qualified sons of ours who showed interest”.
