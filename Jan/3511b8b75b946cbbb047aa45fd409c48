OWERRI – Some stakeholders have de­manded for equity and fair­ness in the appointment of the next chairman of the Imo State Council of Traditional Rulers (Eze Imo). They are from the Imo North (Okigwe zone) area of Imo State, under the aegis of Okigwe Leaders Assembly (OLA). While calling on Governor Hope Uzodimma to consider Imo North Senatorial District, otherwise known as Okigwe Zone, of the new Chairman, also observed that the zone had been left out in the scheme of things for upwards of 18 years.

This was sequel to the disso­lution of the Imo state council of traditional rulers hitherto led by Eze Samuel Ohiri, a week ago, with rumours rife that the governor may be un­der pressure to appoint a new chairman of the council from Imo West, otherwise known as Orlu Zone. At a press conference in Owerri, secretary of the group, Deacon Henry Anyanwu ob­served that the appointment or election of the chairman of the Imo State Council of Tradi­tional Rulers had always been based on zoning and rotation.

Next was Eze Samuel Ohiri who again served nine years under the administrations of Rochas Okorocha, Emeka Ihe­dioha and Senator Hope Uzod­imma. It naturally follows that the next chairman of Imo state Council of Traditional Rulers should come from Okigwe Zone. “However, in the past few days, there have been rumours on the attempts to appoint a traditional ruler from Orlu Zone as the new chairman of Imo Council of Tradition­al Rulers. This information, which we believe is a rumour, was given some credence by some Owerri-based newspa­pers”. While accusing an un­named cabal from Orlu Zone of sponsoring the plot to ap­point the new Eze Imo from Orlu, the group insisted that the attempt to appoint anoth­er Eze Imo from Orlu Zone would be against equity, good conscience, fairness and nat­ural justice. The group therefore de­manded that the next chair­man, Imo Council of Tradi­tional Rulers be chosen from Okigwe zone, expressing con­fidence that Governor Uzodim­ma would show leadership and serve the interest of justice and equity.
