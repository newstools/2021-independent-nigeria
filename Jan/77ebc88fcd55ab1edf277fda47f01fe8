LAGOS  – Concerned about what he de­scribed as plan by some persons to marginalize Lagos indigenes in the appointment of a new Vice-Chancellor for the Lagos State University, Major-Gener­al Tajudeen Olanrewaju (Rtd), former Minister of Communi­cations has advised Governor Babajide Sanwo-Olu to ensure that Lagos indigenes are not marginalised for the sake of fairness and equity. InareleaseonSaturday, Olan­rewaju advised the Governor to take the right and proper deci­sion in this delicate times when voices are rising every day about the brazen marginalization of the native Lagosians, stressing that history would judge every­one for whatever role they play in the challenging moment. The ex-Minister said despite the various outcries and public interventions by many indige­nous stakeholders about the at­tempt to skew and muddle the appointment of a new VC for the Lagos State University in favour of Professor Ibiyemi Bello, the wife of Mr Tunji Bello who has been in public office for well over 20 years , the Lagos State government issued a statement which out rightly cancelled the former proceedings where four leading indigenous candidates had emerged as the clear front­runners, with Mrs Bello making the rear.
