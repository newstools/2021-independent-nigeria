To its credit, Giving.ng decided to raise a N1 billion fund to support the healthcare workers who are helping people infected with the Covid-19 to get better. The fund enabled payments of a hazard allowance of N100,000 to frontline healthcare workers as opposed to their statutory hazard allowance estimated to be N5,000 only. In his welcome address, Mr. Olajide Bamigbowu, President of the EMBA 24 Class, noted that the class was one of the very few programmes that Covid-19 could not disrupt. He said: “The year 2020 will go down in history as the end and beginning of a new era. Just like we have dispensations marked by monumental occurrences, there will be many references to the pre and post Covid-19 era for generations to come.” He said the year witnessed the full-blown impact of the novel virus which has challenged systems and ideologies. The virus disrupted all that it could and even those that people assumed it could not before it ushered in a new world, Bamigbowu said.
