The Association of Ebonyi State Indigenes in the Diaspora (AESID) says competent and credible leadership should be the yardstick for determining Gov. Dave Umahi’s successor rather than zoning. Mr. Paschal Oluchukwu, President, AESID, said this in a statement on Sunday in Abuja, urging people of Ebonyi to elect a leader who would run an all-inclusive government in 2023. “Come 2023, Ebonyi people should choose, follow, support and elect a leader who will run an all-inclusive government that will see humans as humans and not as machines.” ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY.

He urged the people not to elect any leader that had shown signs of greed and looting. “The people should not support anyone hanging on the shoulders and integrity of any leader,” he said.
