He said that though herdsmen in the area, just as in other parts of the country, have not had it so rosy the situation was not hopeless.

According to him, Gov. Dave Umahi had made interventions as well as demonstrated creditable interest in forestalling cri­sis and in mitigating their effects where they break out. “Therefore, I implore our herders, not to panic and leave their locations but to only make calculated movements without giving the wrong impression of aggression against them where none exists. “We will continue to appreciate Umahi for his steadfastness in seeking to propagate the hospitality the Igbos are known for, the daunting challenges he is facing notwithstanding,” he said.
