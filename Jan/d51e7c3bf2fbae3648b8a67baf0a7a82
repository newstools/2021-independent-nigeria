Nicola Sturgeon told ITV’s Good Morning Britain that some ‘essential’ stores could be closed to provide fewer reasons for people to go outside. Sturgeon said: “There is a question in my mind about whether we need to go a bit further in restricting non-essential business activities to cut even further the reasons that people have for being outside of their own home and that’s something I will be looking at with my advisers over the next few days.” Under current restrictions, food retailers, off-licences, newsagents, petrol stations, post offices are allowed to continue operating.
