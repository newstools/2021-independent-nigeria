ONITSHA – Sacked Access Bank staff of No­vember 2020 batch, in the South East states, Wednesday in Onitsha, Anambra State, protested alleged illegal dismissal without benefits even as one collapsed on the process of the protest. The protesters who marched through some major roads and final­ly landed at the gate of Basilica of Most Holy Trinity, Onitsha, said they were in the church premises for God to hear their prayers and not man. Some of them carried placards with the inscriptions, “CBN/NLC/ Bankers Committee come to our rescue; Access Bank at it again, sacking staff without lay-off bene­fits; Access Bank mystery shopping video, amidst Covid-19 Access Bank sacked three times in 2020; Working Monday to Sunday no benefits for 10 years; over 300 sacked in South East on November 2020 without benefits; Access Bank show us the mystery video clip you claimed you used to rate our performance and sacked us,” among others.
