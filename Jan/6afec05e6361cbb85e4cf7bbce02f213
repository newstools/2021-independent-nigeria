Sky Sports pundits Andy Cole and Darren Bent agree that Manchester United deserved to win the key penalty in the win over Aston Villa at Old Trafford. The Reds moved level with leaders Liverpool thanks to the 2-1 victory over Villa, with Anthony Martial opening the scoring in the first half as the host led at the break.

I think the problem nowadays is that with the faintest of touches, anyone is going to go down. “If you look at it there is a touch and he’s gone down. Man United have got a penalty out of it and it’s the right call.” Bent added: “There is contact and for me it’s the right decision. Even if you look at it and think it’s a bit harsh, I don’t think there is enough to overturn it. It’s the correct decision.” SHOCKING!
