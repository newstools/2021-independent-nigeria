In what will surely be one of the few moves that happens during this transfer window for Bayern Munich, Ivan Mihaljević has left the campus in favor of a transfer to Regionalliga Südwest side TSV Steinbach. The 19-year-old center-back prospect is a Munich native with dual eligibility for international with Germany and Croatia: Mihaljević played 14 games for Bayern Munich’s U-19 squad last season per Transfermarkt. ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY. DON'T BE A VICTIM! With so many top-notch defensive prospects on campus, Mihaljević was likely caught in a numbers game. Chris Richards and Tanguy Nianzou are already with the senior team, while Liam Morrison, Bright-Arrey Mbi, and Jamie Lawrence are all considered quality young players for the future of Bayern Munich’s back-line. Even more, Darmstadt-loanee Lars Lukas Mai is having a terrific season in 2. Bundesliga, which adds to the organizational congestion. Assuredly, this window will contain more moves within the youth ranks than the senior team for Bayern Munich. SHOCKING!
