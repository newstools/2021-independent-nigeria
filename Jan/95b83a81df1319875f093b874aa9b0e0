Kuwait’s Emir pardoned 600 prisoners, local security sources reported yesterday. The sources told Al-Qabas that 120 of those pardoned would be released in “early February”, adding that the rest would see a “penalty reduction or fine exemption”. None of those receiving a pardon are being held on state security charges, the sources added. Those affected were chosen by the “head of the Supreme Committee for Emiri Pardon at the Kuwaiti Ministry of the Interior, in cooperation with other relevant authorities.” ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY.
