LAGOS – Mr. Paul Gbededo, the Group Managing Director, Flour Mills Nigeria Plc, has said that industrialisation in Nige­ria is being stifled by unstable political environment, dearth of basic infrastructure, poor macroeconomic manage­ment, over regulation and multiple taxation, among others. Gbededo, who spoke at the just-concluded annual confer­ence of the Nigerian Society of Chemical Engineers, in Port Harcourt, frowned at the nation’s unstable political landscape, which he said, was still characterised by youth, ethnic, religious restiveness, insecurity and policy incon­sistencies. Speaking in a paper titled, ‘Domestic Manufacturing: Opportunities and Challeng­es’ Gbededo, stated that the operating landscape in Nige­ria’s business environment was riddled with adverse challenges, including dearth of basic infrastructure, poor macroeconomic manage­ment, over regulation and multiple taxation.
