The Colleges of Education Academic Staff Union (COEASU) has said that students of tertiary in­stitutions have stayed at home for too long over the outbreak of COVID-19, an acute respiratory ailment caused by the novel corona­virus that has held the en­tire world to ransom since January last year. The Federal Government had in March 2020, ordered the closure of all educational in­stitutions nationwide, which included tertiary, secondary and primary schools, in a precautionary step taken to curb the spread of the deadly COVID-19 in the country. While secondary and pri­mary schools were allowed to open in October last year before the emergence of the second wave of the ravaging global pandemic, tertiary in­stitutions had remained closed for almost 10 months now.

President of COEASU, Com­rade Nuhu Ogirima, while stat­ing that though those against reopening schools were mak­ing some sense, maintained that it was inimical to keep students at home in perpetuity.
