AdvertisementUranium refined to 20% fissile purity is well above the 5% generally regarded as suitable for producing civilian nuclear energy and shortens Iran’s potential path to 90% purity required for a nuclear bomb. Iran denies any intent to weaponize enrichment.”There will have to be a clear understanding on how the initial terms and provisions of the JCPOA (nuclear deal) are going to be recompiled with,” Grossi said.Tehran started violating the 2015 accord in 2019 in a step-by-step response to President Donald Trump’s withdrawal from it in 2018 and to the reimposition of U.S. sanctions that had been rescinded under the deal.
