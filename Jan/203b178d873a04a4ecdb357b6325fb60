KANO- Kano state government on Sunday insisted that January 18th date slated for resumption of Schools across the state is sacrosanct. A statement by Aliyu Yusuf, Chief Public Relation Officer, Ministry of Education Kano State, called on the general public to disregard rumour of purported change in resumption date. The signed statement by Mr. Yusuf that was made available to INDEPENDENT reads: “Kano state Commissioner of Education, Malam Muhammad Sanusi Sa’id Kiru has disputed the widely circulated rumour that schools in Kano will not resume on Sunday 17th and Monday 18th of January respectively.

Clearing the air to that effect, the Commissioner reaffirmed the earlier directives issued by the ministry that all Boarding schools students in the state should resume Today Sunday the 17th of January 2021 while Day students are to resume Tomorrow Monday 18th of January 2021. He therefore, urged parents, guardians and the general public to discard the widely circulated rumour, saying that it is not true, as Kano state government has no plan for extending the resumption dates.
