Arsenal midfielder Dani Ceballos has dropped a big hint over his long-term future as he spends a second season on loan from Real Madrid. The Spain international had a mixed first season at the Emirates Stadium, but ended the campaign strongly once Mikel Arteta replaced Unai Emery as manager. Ceballos then agreed to join Arsenal on a second loan this term, and he’s now provided an update on his future that perhaps points more towards a long-term career at parent club Real Madrid.

The Gunners would do well to keep a talent like Ceballos on their books, but it’s also easy to imagine that Real will want to keep him as a long-term successor to ageing midfield players like Luka Modric and Toni Kroos. Of course, it’s not yet clear that Los Blancos definitely will take that decision, but it seems Ceballos is prioritising a career with them in the future, despite also heaping praise onto Arteta for his style of management.
