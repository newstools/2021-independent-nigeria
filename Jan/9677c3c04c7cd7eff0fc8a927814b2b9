Rev. (Dr) Dele Asaju, Assistant Secretary, Christian Association of Nigeria (CAN), Lagos State, has called on Nigerians to be at peace with one another saying, “If we follow peace with all men there would be peace in Nigeria.” He stated this in a sermon, at Ifako-Ijaiye CAN chapter annual thanksgiving and lunching of 2021 and 2022 calendar. Taking his reading from Hebrew chapter 12 verse 14 that says, “Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man shall see the Lord,” Asaju maintained that many Christians are holy but not at peace with all men. “If you pursue peace with all men you will be able to win their hearts to Christ. How can you preach to a man you are fighting with? If you are holy and not peaceful you are not of God. The two must balance,” he asserted.

He also faulted ministers who are too particular about titles and easily get angry when they are not addressed as such saying that “God is not interested in titles. And I want it stopped in Christendom.” Also speaking at the event, Prophet Olubode Sobukola, CAN Chairman, Ifako-Ijaiye Chapter, said that the annual thanksgiving and launch of calendar was always a time the Christian body comes together to give glory to God for the privilege to see another year.
