The management of Lagos State University (LASU) has declared the planned protest by a faceless group called “SOROSOKE LASUITE” against the hike in tuition fee as pre-emptive, needless and a belligerent move being sponsored by a group of people called “The Toxic”. Responding to Daily Independent Online inquiries, the spokesman of LASU, Mr. Ademola Adekoya explained again that: “The school fee increment is not for the current crop of students at all levels. Those who are to pay the increased school fees are not yet our students. Those candidates have every right to look elsewhere for admission. It is a matter of choice.

DON'T BE A VICTIM! “The present students are still paying the old school fees. “On the increase, every stakeholder was carried along including the staff and students union body and the government.

The student body and all other stakeholders in the University were consulted before the increment and it only affects new candidates coming into the University. Daily Independent reports that a group with no particular identifiable signatory had posted the following notice intended to generate controversy on the LASU general WhatsApp Group: Solidarity greetings to all gallant comrades and students on campus, It is no more news that there is an outrageous hike in LASU school fees, albeit the previous and constant increment of other payable students fees like the medical, matriculation and convocation fees (to mention a few). Last year was met with the introduction of STREAM 1 and STREAM 2 admission formats which those aware of the management style of fee increment know it’s just another ploy to increase the school fee and nothing more. “Now the challenge has been brought to us with their belief that we will take anything thrown at us, the question Is; We commend the efforts of the union,but It’s high time we take the bull by its horn as we can’t longer stand akimbo. On this note we call for a peaceful demonstration Tommorow 8th of January 2021 by 6:00 am we converge at the Lasu-igando gate, no movement into and outside the school till our voice is heard We repeat Its a peaceful demonstration,An injury to one is an injury to all SignedSORO SOKE Lasuite Aluta continua ✊🏿
