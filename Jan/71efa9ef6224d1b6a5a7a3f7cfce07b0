Botswana President Mokgweetsi Masisi on Monday called for an enhanced commitment by workers in both the public and private sectors to make Botswana competitive. “Each one of us has a role to play in the development of Botswana, particularly because productivity is a key driver of our economy,” wrote the southern African country’s leader on his Twitter account. Masisi said this when he was wishing all workers in both public and private sectors a “happy and productive first day at work” on Monday.

Late last year, Masisi mentioned that his aim is to make Botswana a land of small stock production as a way of creating the much-needed employment and business opportunities for locals in the agricultural sector. Masisi embarked on an exercise of donating bucks and rams to several small scale stock farmers in different rural areas of the country between September and December in 2020, as a way of ramping up small stock production in the southern African country.
