The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has said that the ‘wait on God’ for solutions to the insecurity in the country’s statement credited to Buhari presidency, is a direct admission of failure by President Muhammadu Buhari. The party noted that the statement has shown clearly that the Buhari administration is completely helpless and has come to its wits end in governance; a development, which validates the position of majority of Nigerians that President Buhari is grossly incompetent and should step aside. This statement, the PDP said has further goes to confirm that the Buhari’s administration has outlived its usefulness, if it had any, and that the promises and assurances made by President Buhari, on the fight against insecurity amount to mere lip service.

PDP, in a statement by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan said, “while we believe in the powers and interventions of God, our party restates that such comes with the commitment, determination and show of responsibility on the part of those in leadership position; an obligation in which the Buhari Presidency has completely failed.” The party said that it finds it disturbing that while the nation passes through this trying time, officials of the Buhari Presidency are shamelessly alluding to how they sleep in comfort of their homes “ensconced in the tender bosom” of their “wives and girlfriend.
