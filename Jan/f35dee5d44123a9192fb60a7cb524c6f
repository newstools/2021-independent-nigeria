President-elect Joe Biden has nominated Judge Merrick Garland to serve as attorney general of the U.S. Justice Department, according to multiple reports. The judge was previously nominated by former President Barack Obama to serve on the Supreme Court, though he was blocked from the nomination process by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Republicans on Capitol Hill. News of the nomination comes as Congress convenes to certify the president-elect’s victory in the 2020 elections, and as the Georgia runoff elections appear to show gains for the Democratic Party.

Mr Garland, who has served on the federal appeals bench since 1997, is no stranger to the Justice Department. Prior to becoming a judge, he worked as a federal prosecutor where he helped secure a conviction against Timothy McVeigh for the Oklahoma City bombing. He was also on the team that helped secure a conviction of former District of Columbia Mayor Marion Barry for cocaine possession. Mr Garland held other key posts at the Justice Department, including serving as principal deputy associate attorney general to Deputy Attorney General Jamie Gorelick starting in 1994.
