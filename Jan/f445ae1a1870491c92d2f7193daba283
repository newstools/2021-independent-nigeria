LAGOS – Jigawa’s two-goal hero in the 3-1 win away at Abia Warriors on Wednesday, Samuel Stone, says their victory was pro­pelled by the continuous tag­ging of his side as underdogs in the Nigeria Professional Football League (NPFL). Stone, whose goals in the 74th and 85th minute aided Gilbert Opana’s men to their first win away since April 2008, in a chat with npfl.ng, reflected on his team’s victory against the Umuahia side, describing it as a tip of the iceberg. “I needed to score to regain my confidence. I missed out on the starting eleven against Rangers due to injury and the result was quite disappointing. We needed to make a state­ment here today (Wednesday).

Asides from keeping our place in the league, it is also my desire to see the team be in the top three and earn a continental ticket by end of the season. “This can be achieved through hard work and dedica­tion. If we are consistent with this sort of performance (against Abia Warriors), that dream is achievable”, he posited. The former Go Round FC and Kano Pillars forward will be key to Jigawa’s fortunes in the new campaign, as the team looks forward to better last sea­son’s one goal per game average ratio (25 goals from 25 games).
