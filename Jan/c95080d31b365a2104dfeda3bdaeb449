Manchester United will host the Premier League champions, Liverpool, in the FA Cup fourth round. Monday night’s draw pitched United into battle with Jürgen Klopp’s men and the encounter will take place just a week after Ole Gunnar Solskjær’s side take on Liverpool in the Premier League on Sunday. The last time the Merseyside club won the FA Cup, in 2006, they beat United on the way to the final, winning 1-0 in the fifth round.

Fulham take on Burnley in an all-Premier League matchup while League Two side Crawley Town, who upset Leeds United, are away at Bournemouth. The draw for the fifth round was also made on Monday, with the Premier League’s ‘Big Six’ avoiding match-ups against each other should they advance. Should Chorley pull off a shock against Wolves, they could have another big date ahead of them after the fifth-round draw pitched the winners to face either Southampton, Shrewsbury or 14-time winners Arsenal. Chorley manager Jamie Vermiglio told BBC Sport: “That’s what we really wanted, Premier League opposition, great. And there’s a bit of history because in 1986, Chorley played against Wolves at home and beat them 3-0, so we just need to do that again.” Southampton’s third-round tie with Shrewsbury is yet to be decided after the game was called off when Shrewsbury reported Covid-19 cases in their squad. The victors in the Manchester United v Liverpool showdown will face Stockport, West Ham or Doncaster, while either Wycombe or Tottenham will travel to the winners of the Everton v Sheffield Wednesday tie.
