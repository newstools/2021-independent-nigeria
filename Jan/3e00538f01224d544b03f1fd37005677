Obaseki said that in keeping with his promise to bequeath Edo with a 30-year Master Plan, the government had secured the services of experts to begin the process of designing the Urban and Regional Master Plan. “I will be launching Project Clean and Green Edo this year. This project will involve residents and corporate participation in beautification and planting of trees, particularly in urban areas,’’ he said. He said the escape of almost 2,000 prisoners escaped from correctional centres in the state had compounded the security situation. “We are building a robust security system to deal with the peculiar challenges that we now face,”  he said. The governor disclosed that his administration would be launching Operation ‘Know Your Neighbour,’ Campaign, where residents would be requested to provide information and the identities of all those who live close to them.
