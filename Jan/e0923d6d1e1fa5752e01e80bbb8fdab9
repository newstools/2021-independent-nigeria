Japan’s government on Sunday dismissed suggestions that the 2020 Tokyo Olympics scheduled for this summer could be cancelled owing to the coronavirus pandemic. “We have decided the venues and schedule, and the people involved are working on preparations, including infection control,” the Kyodo news agency quoted government spokesman Katsunobu Kato as saying. The statement came after reports quoted Taro Kono, the minister for administrative and regulatory reform, as saying that “anything can happen” and “it could go either way” with the Games postponed from last year.
