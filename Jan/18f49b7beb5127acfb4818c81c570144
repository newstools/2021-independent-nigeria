While there aren’t hard and fast rules – each game is judged on a case-by-case basis – there are some guidelines. For instance, in the 2020/21 Premier League handbook, clubs have been told “permission will not be granted to postpone a league match where the applicant club has 14 or more players listed on its squad list available.” Teams were permitted earlier this season to name 25 players in their Premier League squad list – and that doesn’t include registered U21 players.
