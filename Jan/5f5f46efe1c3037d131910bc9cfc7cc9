The Dutch government has resigned amid a scandal that saw thousands of families wrongly accused of child welfare fraud. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte announced the Cabinet’s resignation in an address Friday, saying that responsibility for the scandal “ultimately rests with the incumbent Cabinet and nowhere else.” Under the scandal, around 10,000 families in the Netherlands were told to repay tens of thousands of euros of subsidies after being wrongly accused of child welfare fraud.

Rutte made his speech in the aftermath of the publication of a report by the Parliamentary Interrogation Committee on Childcare Allowance, which he called “very tough, but fair.” “On all levels throughout the political-administrative-legal system, mistakes have been made that have resulted in great injustice to thousands of parents,” he remarked.
