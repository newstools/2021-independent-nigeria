Nigerian lenders have indicated that they will increase credit to households in the country in 2021. They are certain that the success recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020 will linger till the first quarter of 2021, according to a report published by the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). The report released by the CBN in December 2020 said lenders increased both secured and unsecured credit to households across the country in 2020. (Secured lending explains a situation when the borrower is required to give the lender collateral as a form of insurance against defaulting on the loan. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender can seize the collateral to recoup its loss. On the other hand, an unsecured loan is a loan that doesn’t require any type of collateral.) The document titled ‘Credit Conditions Survey Report’ conducted by the Bank in December 2020 indicated that the availability of secured credit to households increased in fourth quarter of 2020 and is expected to increase in the first quarter of 2021.
