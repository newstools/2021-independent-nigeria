LAGOS – A boxing enthusiast, Abdul Wahab Adekunle has reward­ed the winner of World Box­ing Federation (WBF) Super Featherweight champion, Ridwan ‘Scorpion’ Oyekola with a jaguar car saying it’s a fulfillment of a promise he made to the boxer. The donor, while present­ing the car worth over N6 mil­lion said he could have given the boxer something more precious than a jaguar car if he could afford it, as noth­ing is too much to appreciate the wonderful feat he had achieved for Nigeria. “Sports has become a big time money spinning venture globally, all over the world we can see the financial land­mark all of them are bringing from Africa to Europe, but it seems we’re yet to come to term with this fact but I be­lieve we can easily get there if we keep to encourage them this way and hope they will keep getting better.

DON'T BE A VICTIM! “I want to use this medium to advise the federal government to identify with sports as anoth­er income earner. It is unthink­able that the United Kingdom post the whooping one billion pounds as foreign exchange income from football alone. We can imagine if we develop and encourage our sports men and women by building facilities to enhance their preparations and see what we will get in return”, said Adekunle, who is the found­er and CEO of Hamex Group. The President of Nigeria Boxing Board of Control (NBB of C) Dr. Rafiu Ladipo who was also present during the presentation thanked the donor that also supported the organization of the boxing event held at Ilaji Sports Re­sort with N10 million in terms of logistics for his spirited ges­ture towards boxing. 2020/2021 NPFL: Rangers International Beat Akwa United 1-0 Malço Mines Team Wins Jos International Annual Polo Tournament “Boxing can only get better if we see spirited people like the CEO of Hamex and Engr. Sanusi of Ilaji Resort coming into this game, definitely this gesture will go a long way to motivate other boxers that there is hope in the home front (Nigeria) and not until they travel abroad before they can make headway in sports”, Dr. Rafiu Ladipo noted.
