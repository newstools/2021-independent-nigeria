Pope Francis on Thursday got the first jab of the COVID-19 vaccine, local media reported. “I can confirm that as part of the vaccination program of the Vatican City State, as of today, the first dose of the COVID-19 vaccine has been administered to Pope Francis and to the Pope Emeritus,” Matteo Bruni, director of the Holy See Press Office, told journalists, according to Vatican News website. The vaccination campaign in the Vatican started on Wednesday. Speaking to the Italian TG5 TV channel on Sunday, Pope Francis said getting vaccinated is an “ethical action” because you are not only gambling with your health and life but also you are with others.
