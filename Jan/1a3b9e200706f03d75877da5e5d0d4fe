ZOLA Electric, one of Africa’s leading renewable energy providers, has announced the donation of high-tech solar power systems to selected Lagos State Government-owned Primary Health Centers (PHCs), as part of its commitment to help fight the resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic through the regular electricity supply to Nigerians. The donations include its flagship product, ZOLA Infinity – the first lithium-ion battery-based hybrid power system in Africa, explicitly designed to incorporate solar electricity generation, energy storage, and power from the grid to deliver reliable 24- hour anywhere. Also included are the uniquely packaged ZOLA Flex Power-1 units, containing grid charger/adapter, DC bulbs/strip lights, Solar Panel, Lithium-Ion battery unit and AC inverter for powering AC appliances.

Speaking on the donation, the Acting Managing Director, ZOLA Electric Nigeria, Mr. Olufemi Ashipa, said: “This donation is a gesture that takes into recognition that this pandemic has hit vulnerable communities disproportionately hard across the world. As proponents of helping Nigeria bridge the huge energy deficit, we understand that inconsistent power delivery to rural communities, especially the primary care clinics, has left them exposed and unable to combat life-threatening diseases, particularly this ravaging virus. “This action aligns with our mission to ‘deliver Clean 24-Hour Power Anywhere’, and so we are confident that these high-tech solar systems, which have been installed at no cost, will enable the PHCs to stay connected and effectively serve their communities. Thus, we have trained the recipients to optimise the power systems’ output and ensure the community enjoys the ZOLA Electric premium technology’s full benefits.”
