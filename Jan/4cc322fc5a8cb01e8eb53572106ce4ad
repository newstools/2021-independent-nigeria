On Thursday, FBI Director Christopher Wray said the agency is preparing for the possibility of more right-wing violence and armed protests during Biden’s swearing-in ceremony. “We are seeing an extensive amount of concerning online chatter, I guess that’s the best way I would describe it, about a number of events surrounding the inauguration,” Wray said at a FEMA event. “And together with our partners, we evaluate those threats and what kind of resources to deploy against them. Right now, we are tracking calls for potential armed protest and activity leading up to the inauguration.”
