Sia has dropped the third single from her film Music this week. This single is a remix of the previously-released, Hey Boy, but this time, the song features Nigerian pop artist, Burna Boy. The upbeat rendition reveals the Grammy-nominated singer/songwriter’s lustful ambitions, with Burna Boy responding with similar needs for satisfaction. The lyrics set up the main theme of the music video, which revolves around an animated version of Sia, who is portrayed as a 21st century Jessica Rabbit. On the theme of lust, Jessica Rabbit appears to be the perfect allure for the visual accompaniment of the song. As fans might expect, Sia is drawn with Jessica Rabbit curves as she performs in an intergalactic night club, while Burn dances his way in as a human/cat hybrid. The album is slated to be out on February 12. Sia has recently released the full tracklist for Music – Songs From and Inspired by the Motion Picture, which includes the original version of Hey Boy and Courage to Change. The movie Music stars Kate Hudson as Zu, “a newly sober drug dealer and self-saboteur” and Sia’s goddaughter Maddie Ziegler, who plays Zu’s autistic half-sister, Music. The film follows Hudson and Ziegler’s characters as they navigate their new relationship with one another. The movie is due to be released in select IMAX theaters in the U.S. beginning February 12.
