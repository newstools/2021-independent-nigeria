DON'T BE A VICTIM! “As a legislature, we had prepared ahead for the vagaries that will for long be associated with 2020 by making the necessary leg­islation for facilitation of good governance and eco­nomic growth. “Ahead of the year, we had restructured our fiscal year to a more predictable January to December cycle and ensured that our budget for 2020 was ready for the new structure.

Equally important is the pas­sage of the Electoral Reform Amendment Bill. This is necessary in order to en­hance the democratic pro­cess of free, fair, transpar­ent and credible election.” Reading out the Senate priority list for the New Year, Lawan explained that the passage of the PIB would boost activities in the oil and gas sector, as the passage of Electoral Reforms Bill before the second quarter of 2021 would consolidate the elec­toral gains so far made. “Also, on our priority list in 2021 is the amend­ment to the 1999 Constitu­tion, which is the grand norm of our being togeth­er as a nation. We have it on our agenda to pull through the process of constitutional amendment in 2021. The process which started in 2020 requires ex­tensive consultations and the buy in of everybody.” The Red Chamber also hopes to give accelerated consideration to measures proposed towards the con­tainment of the COVID-19.
