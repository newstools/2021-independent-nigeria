Agboola, a lecturer at the Faculty of Agriculture, Obafemi Awolowo University (OAU), Ile Ife, said irrigation system could bring lasting solution to the food crisis in Nigeria. “As a famer, I have come to realise that the problem farm­ers encounter is lack of good facilities and infrastructure in their farms. “And for the citizens to es­cape hunger we must produce more food, the South-West governors should collabo­rate and evolve solutions to this problem. “They should adopt mass irrigation farming as the per­manent solution to food crisis in the region,” he stated. Fakayode added: “We have Ikere Gorge Dam at Iseyin in Oyo state, Erelu Water Works, Asejire in Osun and others which can be used to assist farming settlements along these areas.” SHOCKING!
