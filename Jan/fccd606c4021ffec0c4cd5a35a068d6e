With England back in lockdown, Chelsea Football Club is once more providing accommodation at Stamford Bridge to the National Health Service (NHS).Club owner Roman Abramovich will again be covering the costs of providing the accommodation, which includes bed and breakfast, in the Copthorne Hotel. A similar initiative was rolled out last March in response to the first coronavirus outbreak in London. Many of the medical staff will be working long hours and may not be able to travel home or would have to make long commutes at a time when the virus is so transmissible. The rooms will be initially available until the next government review in mid-February. Millennium Hotels and Resorts, who manage the hotel, are supportive and assisting the club in providing this service to the NHS.
