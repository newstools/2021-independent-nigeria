AWKA – Ex-Aviation Minister in the first and second republic, Chief Mbazuluike Amechi; former Women Affairs Min­ister, Mrs Josephine Anenih, and several Nigerians at home and in the diaspora have unanimously endorsed the global movement for Igbo presidency in 2023. They spoke during a world press conference held at Chief Mbazuluike’s country home, Ukpor, Nnewi-South local government area of Anambra State, that a Nige­rian president of southeast extraction was long overdue and that according to equity, it was the turn of the south­east geo-political zone to pro­duce the next president. Anenih and Amechi, however, stressed that said Ndigbo must form a united front devoid of sabotage if they must actualise the Igbo presidency project, saying that it was a noble cause and achievable, even as he added that there must be unity of purpose among the Igbo.

Mrs Anenih observed that Ndigbo seemed to have brought up the rear in the po­litical history of the country, adding that people of the eth­nic group were more patriot­ic and believed very strongly in one Nigeria because of their industry and proficien­cy for economic development wherever they are across the country. Anenih also observed that the southeast region had been disenfranchised from the presidency for too long and that it would only be in tandem with equity, natural justice and good conscience, if a Nigerian president of southeast extraction would emerge in 2023.

Other speakers, who con­tributed to the discussion on the Igbo presidency proj­ect, established that other geo-political zones of the country had had their fair share of the presidency and that it was unarguably the turn of the southeast region to ascend the presidency to change the narratives.
