We will discuss internally what’s the best situation for him what’s the best for the near future, with the player and the agent and try to find the best solution for everybody. “If something is sorted this month it’s because it’s good for both parties, because it’s good for Mesut and his future and because it’s good for the club. If that’s the case we’ll move forward and if not the player will continue here. “He’s been training with us but he had some days because we decided to give him some days for something personal but he’s training with us all the time.” Young striker Folarin Balogun’s future is up in the air at the moment with Arsenal trying to tie him down to fresh terms. On the forward’s situation, Arteta added: “The club wants to make a deal, the manager wants to make a deal, the player wants to stay and I’m not sure about the agent.”
