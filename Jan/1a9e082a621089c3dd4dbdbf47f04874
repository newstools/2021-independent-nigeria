LAGOS – With over 21,000 children who were born in Nigeria on New Year’s Day, the life expec­tancy for the Nigerian child remains one of the lowest globally, the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) said on Friday. An estimated 21,439 babies will be born in Nigeria on New Year’s Day, UNICEF said in a statement made available to Saturday INDEPENDENT. The statement partly reads, “As the calendar turns to 2021, UNICEF is again celebrating the new lives being brought into the world on 1 January. Globally, over half of these births are estimated to take place in 10 countries, with Ni­geria having the third highest number of births at 21,439.” ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY.

Their average life expectan­cy is expected to be 62.8 years – compared to a global average of 84 years. The statement also said that New Years’ babies born in Ghana and neighbouring Ni­ger have life expectancies of 73 and 71.4 years, respectively. Ba­bies born in Central African Republic and Chad will have a similar life expectancy to those born in Nigeria – only 1.4 years less, at 61.4. This is the lowest life expectancy in the world. The highest life expectancy, at 116.4, is for children born in Switzerland. “These figures, while diffi­cult to contemplate, are esti­mates and not predetermined – there are many things we can do to improve the fate of those children born today in Nige­ria. We can and must work to change the underlying factors that can improve the life expec­tancy of Nigerian children,” said Renu Wadhwa, acting UNICEF Nigeria Representa­tive. “This has been a difficult year, and there is perhaps no better way to turn the page than to welcome new young lives into the world. There are many opportunities before us in 2021, and now is the time to begin to build a better society for our children. Children born today will inherit the Nigeria we begin to build for them.” More than 14 million Nige­rian children are chronically malnourished children and 2.7 million acutely malnour­ished. Cross-sectoral solutions to strengthen the health, food, water, sanitation and social protection systems can reverse these high numbers and keep children alive. As much as 43 per cent of Nigerian children do not re­ceive all their recommended vaccinations at the right time – a critical step towards ensur­ing survival and good health. SHOCKING!
