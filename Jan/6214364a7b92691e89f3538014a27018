Ukaegbu told the panel that the Area Police Com­mand in Aba had at a point advised management of the State Teaching Hospital to release the corpse of late Friday, but the hospital told the family that this could only be done when the mor­tuary bill of N350, 000 was. “Since we don’t have that kind of money, late Ikenna Friday has not been in­terred for over four years,” he said.
