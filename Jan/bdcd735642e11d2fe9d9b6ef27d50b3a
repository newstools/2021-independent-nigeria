Oyeleke reiterated that the present administration has zero-tolerance for street trading because of the hazards associated with the act. He decried the environmental nui­sance constituted by the traders who display their wares on the road side, an act which he said, was at the detriment of the safety of the traders and buyers.

The government also emphasised the clean and green initiative, which he maintained should be embraced by all and sundry so as to add aesthetics on many of the major roads and also to check traffic gridlock, caused by street traders. The Commissioner said the state Governor Seyi Makinde has fulfilled his promise not to rid the major roads around markets in Oyo State of street traders until alternative spaces and shops were created for them, which according to him, has been done at the Scout Camp Neighborhood Market, among others.
