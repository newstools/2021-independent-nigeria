These murals are an exact depiction of that; they are a reminder of Nigeria’s rich history and diverse cultures, as well as the many things that bind the Nigerian people together.” Earlier last year, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Coca-Cola Company launched a global campaign themed Open Like Never Before, encouraging people to open themselves up to the ‘new normal’, make the most of every moment and share those treasured moments with those around them. In the spirit of togetherness, positivity and inclusivity, the company is extending this message even further with this wall mural project. The year 2020 may have been fraught with challenges the world over, but as a nation, Nigeria and Nigerians have stayed strong and are hopeful for a better future. Coca-Cola Nigeria charges consumers to celebrate this hope as a bright spot of 2020, and to hold on to it in 2021. SHOCKING!
