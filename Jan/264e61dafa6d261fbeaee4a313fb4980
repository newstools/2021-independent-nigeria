LAGOS – Chief Martin Onovo, former presidential candidate of the National Conscience Party (NCP), has taken a hard look at the 2021 budget recently signed by President Muhammadu Buhari, describing it as a dreadful destruction of the future of the national economy and enslavement of Nigerians. Speaking with DAILY INDEPENDENT on Tuesday, Onovo, Head, Policy Positions, Movement for Fundamental Change (MFC), lamented that the N13.588 trillion budget, which provided N3.324 trillion for debt servicing, had a deficit of over N5.7 trillion, which he said was not good for the survival of the nation. He said: “The recurrent expenditure of N5.642 trillion represents the highest and most wasteful since independence. The budget deficit of N5.7 trillion is clearly reckless and unpatriotic.

So, we are borrowing to service debts. “That is evidence that Nigeria is in a debt trap and will soon land in a debt crisis, if we continue with reckless and unpatriotic borrowing. Clearly, this is a budget of economic destruction, waste and corruption.” Otedola, Dantata, Others Pre- Order ‘Strategic Turnaround’ Ikpeazu Commissions Four New Roads In Aba Expatiating, Onovo stressed that the budget proposal of N13.08 trillion presented by President Muhammadu Buhari and the Senate endorsed version of N13.588 trillion, “are consistent with the desperation of the ruling party to destroy the country. “The profligate budget proposal and the prodigal Senate version are the evidence of the desperation of the ruling party to destroy Nigeria.
