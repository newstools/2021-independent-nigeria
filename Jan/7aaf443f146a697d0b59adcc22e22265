A group, Critical Stakeholders of All Progressives Congress (APC) in Kwara, has appealed to President Muhammadu Buhari and the party’s leadership to intervene in the current crisis rocking the party in the state. The leader of the group, Mr Akogun Oyedepo, made the appeal on Wednesday in Abuja while briefing newsmen at the APC National Secretariat. Oyedepo said the decision of the Gov. Mai Mala Buni-led APC Caretaker and Extra-Ordinary Convention Planning Committee to remove the state’s chairman of the party, Bashir Bolarinwa, had led to a crisis in the chapter.

Oyedepo said the group had explored all opportunities to ensure peace in Kwara, including meeting with the governor and the party’s leadership without success.
