Pope Francis on Sunday conveyed a special salutation to those who start the new year with more difficulties, the sick, the unemployed and those who live in situations of oppression and exploitation.In a comment after Sunday’s Angelus prayer from the Library of the Apostolic Palace, the Holy Pontiff noted, ‘We don’t know what 2021 will bring us, but what each of us and we all together can do is to commit ourselves a little more to caring for one another, to creation, to our common house.’ It is true, there is the temptation to take care of our own interests, to continue to wage the war, for example, to focus on the economic profile only, to live hedonistically, that is, only seeking the satisfaction of our own pleasures, the Pope noted.
