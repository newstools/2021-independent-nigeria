ONITSHA – The coronation of Godwin Odiegwu as traditional ruler in Abacha, Idemili North Local Government Area of Anambra State on Saturday almost turned bloody, but for the quick inter­vention of security personnel at the venue of the coronation ceremony. Over 200 youths of the com­munity, under the aegis of Unit­ed Abacha Youths Association (UAYA), had stormed the venue of the coronation ceremony, chanting songs depicting their displeasure over plans by a section of the community to inaugurate another traditional ruler, when the former monarch is still alive. Daily Independent gathered that the atmosphere became tensed when the youths attempt­ed to disrupt the ceremony, but were forcefully dispersed by security personnel made up of police and army, who applied used canisters on them. ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY. DON'T BE A VICTIM! Youths replied them with stones, forcing everybody, in­cluding those that came for the coronation ceremony, to scam­per for safety. However, the coronation held when normalcy was restored.
