It is the sixth time that the tournament, in which only players competing in the local league of their country can participate, will be held.

The Carthage Eagles are not the only big name to be missing from the tournament, as Nigeria, South Africa, Ghana and Senegal were all knocked out in the qualifying rounds. But in their absence, there will be plenty of talent on display, as two-time champions DR Con­go (2009 and 2016) take on 2014 winners Libya in Group B, with Con­go and Niger the other teams.
