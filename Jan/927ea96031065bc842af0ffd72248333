Subscribers to national tele­communications company, Globacom, who have not used their lines for 30 con­secutive days will henceforth enjoy 22 times value on every recharge of N100 and above. This is courtesy of the newly unveiled Glo offer, 22X plan, which also comes with unprecedented 5GB free data and hundreds of bonus minutes every month for 3 months, depending on the amount recharged. In a statement in Lagos, Globacom described the of­fer as another opportunity to give its subscribers a de­lightful calling experience on its network, adding that that this is by far the big­gest of such bonus being offered by any operator in the market.

The company said: “The plan which empowers cus­tomers to satisfy their browsing and calling needs is another effort by Globa­com to give its subscribers more value for their mon­ey. The customer does not need to dial any USSD code to migrate or memorize a special recharge string, rather they will get the offer automatically when they simply recharge their lines with N100 or more. What’s more, the customer still gets the full recharge amount in his/her main ac­count, with 100% freedom to use it the way he or she wants”.
