Government needs to do much more. By this, I mean create the enabling environment for a level playing field for private sector investors. Government must make huge in infrastructure. More than half of all of Nigeria’s housing is estimated to be substandard – either built out of compliance with building codes, or illegally on someone else’s land, or both. This must be formalized somehow. The path is complex, and the risk of granting undeserved amnesty is great … but cities must formalize, and the longer it is delayed, the more damage the delay does to urbanisation and national growth. Government must key into the Nigerian Housing Finance Programme; create a rental housing association model for providing affordable homes; diversify FMBN from supply oriented to demand oriented; create a national urban regeneration; allow state governments to obtain nationally owned land. The country must look inwards and promote local industries; encourage our universities and polytechnics to do research through focused and sustained funding; support agencies responsible for research and development; be less dependent on importation of building materials. ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY. DON'T BE A VICTIM! The Ministry of Works and Housing, Central Bank of Nigeria, Nigeria Mortgage Refinancing Company; Federal Mortgage bank of Nigeria and Nigeria Housing Finance Programme are working to solve the vacuum created due to unavailability of data. In addition, the Federal Government should encourage organisations and other private sector players who have done extensive studies in this regard.
