LAGOS – Ghana-born Enyim­ba midfielder, Fa­rouk Mohammed, believes they can overcome the three goals deficit against Al-Mer­reikh of Sudan in the sec­ond leg of their CAF Cham­pions League competition on Wednesday. Enyimba must score four un-replied for them to overcome Seifeldin Ma­lik hat-trick that propelled Al-Merreikh to a 3-0 CAF Champions League last 32 first leg victory. “The loss in Sudan comes once in a while. Even the strongest clubs sometimes suffer such defeats. Now, so much de­pends on how we react to it.

DON'T BE A VICTIM! “Hopefully, if we get our acts together and play as a team with full determina­tion, we can scale through to the next round, though, it will not be easy,” he said. A 3-0 victory for Enyim­ba after 90 minutes would take the tie straight to a penalty shootout, but if Al Merrikh score just once in the match on Wednesday, the hosts will need five goals to survive.

Enyimba suffered a 4-1 loss away to ASEC Mimo­sas of Code d’ Ivoire in a 2002 qualifier and a 3-1 home victory as insuffi­cient to avoid elimination. Meanwhile, Al Mer­rikh players and officials on Sunday arrived Nige­ria for the encounter and will want to play out their hearts in the match to get the cash promised by the club’s president; Ahmed Taha Al-Tazi. Ahmed Taha Al-Tazi has promised the team $250,000 as cash reward to stop Eny­imba International in Aba from scaling through to the next round of the compe­tition. SHOCKING!
