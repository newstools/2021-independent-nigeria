Borno State Governor, Babagana Umara Zulum has directed officials to pay visits and conduct a quali­ty assessment on all private primary and secondary schools in Borno State. According to the govern­ment, the move was meant to identify illegal schools that exploit parents and guardians without the ca­pacity to impact knowledge on students. Zulum gave that direc­tive in response to the rec­ommendation of a keynote speaker, Alhaji Mohammed Adam during the commis­sioning of Ansar Academy on Monday in Maiduguri. ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY. DON'T BE A VICTIM! Adam had called the gov­ernment’s attention to the existence of quack private schools operating in the state. “I have keenly listened to the keynote address by my brother, Mohammed Adam, and I was attracted to some issues he raised. One of which is a remind­er that our responsibility to monitor the quality of private schools, not just public schools. In that re­gard, I have directed the secretary to the state gov­ernment to notify the State Universal Basic Education Board (SUBEB) Chairman, Dr Shettima Kullima to de­ploy officials to examine the capacity of all private schools.
