Abuja- The Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) has rejected the New Year ‘gift’ of hike in electricity tariff as approved by the All Progressives Congress (APC)-led federal government and urge President Muhammadu Buhari to immediately rescind the increase. The party described the 100 percent hike in electricity tariff from N2 to N4 per kWhr, as announced by the National Electricity Regulatory Commission (NERC), as insensitive, anti-people and will worsen the economic hardship being faced by Nigerians at this time. The party, in a statement by its spokesman, Kola Ologbondiyan contended that the reasons adduced by NERC is not enough to warrant such an increase in electricity tariff, especially at the time Nigerians are looking up to government for economic recovery programmes and packages.

The PDP urged the APC and its government to note that such electricity tariff hike, at this critical time, will bear more pressure on homes and businesses, impact negatively on the national productivity and make life more unbearable, particularly at this period of insufferable economic recession. “What our nation needs at this point are positive policies that will encourage Nigerians in their productive endeavours and cushion the hardship they face on daily basis instead of wicked policies that will only worsen their situation.” Churning Out Lies, False Performance Claims Will Not Save APC From Accounting For Atrocities In Office- PDP We Will Ensure Security For Investors, Their Investments- Bello “It is imperative for the federal government to note that Nigerians are already weighed down by high costs and weak purchasing powers and as such should not be further burdened with high electricity costs.” “Our party therefore asks President Buhari to immediately review the hike and make further consultations on more affordable ways to meet the power need of the nation instead of this resort to tariff hike”, the party said.
