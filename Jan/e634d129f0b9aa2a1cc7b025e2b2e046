LAGOS – The Nigerian Foot­ball Federation (NFF) must go back to school sports if the country’s age group football will revive again. This is the position of Henry Nwosu (MON), former coach of the Golden Eaglets, while reacting to the team’s poor showing at the ongo­ing WAFU B tournament in Togo. The mini tournament serves as qualifiers for the 2021 CAF U-17 Nations Cup in Morocco in July. Golden Eaglets drew 1-1 with Ghana on Saturday, a result that meant the former world champions must wait for the result in the match be­tween Ghana and Cote d’Ivo­ire on Tuesday to see if they qualify for the 2021AFCON.
