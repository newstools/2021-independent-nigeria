Kolo gave the warning during a sympathy visit at Madinatu and Elmiskeen IDP camp over the fire incident that occured in the camp on Friday. She said that about 17 shelters and some food items were razed in the incident which rendered some of the displaced families homeless.

She said that the fire likely stemmed from a cooking fire that grew out of control, noting that the camp’s residents’ ignorance of fire safety oversight made such fires common. “Most of the local people cook their meals in the open spaces outside their tents during the dry season and when the wind blows toward the direction, the shelters are easily razed by fire,” she said. 14 Dead, 9 Injured In Kogi Auto Crash 5 Children, 9 Others Die In Kogi Motor Accident Kolo, however, delivered food and non food items from the agency to the effected families to alleviate their surfferings.
