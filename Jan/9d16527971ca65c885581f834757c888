Liverpool were ‘offered the chance’ to sign Arsenal defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos this month amid a defensive injury crisis at Anfield. The 32-year-old is surplus to requirements at the Emirates and has been linked with Genoa and Real Betis already in this transfer window. The Greece international was not registered in Arteta’s Premier League squad for the first half of the 2020/21 season, leaving him stuck on the sidelines like fellow outcast Mesut Ozil.

And speaking on the Here We Go Podcast, journalist Fabrizio Romano revealed the experienced defender – who worked with Reds boss Jurgen Klopp at Borussia Dortmund – is being considered as a potential option by club hierarchy. “He was offered to Liverpool too, you know that? Liverpool were looking for an opportunity and he was offered to Liverpool, but at the moment he’s not an option,” Romano explained.

Klopp has previously said Liverpool will not be signing a defender this month, but these latest developments indicate he may yet delve into the market for an experienced head like Sokratis for the second half of the campaign.
