LAGOS – After a decade of withdrawing from pastoral ministry, Sign Fireman, a popular man of God has come out with a new revelation on the “The Final Move of God”, saying that the three members of the trinity are not the same. This is against popular Christian belief that the three members of the trinity, God the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, have the same attributes and are all omnipotent, omniscient and omnipresent. But Fireman said that the belief is the cause of many unanswered prayers. ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY. DON'T BE A VICTIM! The man of God, who is also the visionary of the Sign Fireman Ministries, stated this in a chat with the media in Lagos, where he also claimed that Jesus appeared to him in 2014 after years of seeking God’s face to get answers why many promises of God in the Bible are not fulfilled in the lives of many Christians. The revelation which he called the ‘The Final Move Of God’, he said, would cause a shift in the body of Christ.
