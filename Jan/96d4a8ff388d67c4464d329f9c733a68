LAGOS – Patrick Onwura Nzechukwu, Pres­ident, Society For West African In­ternal Audit Practitioners (SWAIAP), has taken a crit­ical look at the 2021 federal budget recently signed by President Muhammadu Bu­hari, lamenting that going by the nation’s high debt profile, Nigeria is heading back to the pre-2006 era when the country was also neck-deep in foreign debt. Nzechukwu, a sea­soned auditor who spoke exclusively to SUNDAY INDEPENDENT in Lagos, lamented that Nigeria re­corded an external debt of $31.99billion in September 2020, the highest since it paid off Paris Club debt in 2006. He stated: “In 2020, the Senate passed a budget of N13.59 trillion instead of N13.08 trillion submitted by the Executive. Out of this figure, a whooping N3.32 trillion was provided for debt servicing, represent­ing about 24% of total bud­get, 3.31% less than 2020 equivalent.

While oil revenue was projected at N2.01 trillion, he noted that non-oil reve­nue was estimated at N1.49 trillion, and grants and aids put at N354.85 billion. Also revenues of 60 gov­ernment-owned enterpris­es (net surplus) were put at N1.35 trillion, Special Funds, N300 billion; and others at N1.42 trillion. According to him, “Cur­sory look at the ratio of external revenue versus internal revenue estimates and its impact in the econ­omy will give insight why the Naira will remain un­der perpetual pressure. “Of the estimated N7.99 trillion generatable rev­enue, only N2.36 trillion from oil, aid and grant is the external revenue, while the balance of N5.63 trillion would be internally gener­ated.
