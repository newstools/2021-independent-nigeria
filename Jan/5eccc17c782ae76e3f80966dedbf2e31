Mauricio Pochettino wants to end Dele Alli’s north London nightmare by offering him a safe haven in the French capital following his PSG appointment. The former England midfielder enjoyed his best years playing under the former Spurs boss, registering 18 goals in 36 appearances for the club as they narrowly missed out on the Premier League title in 2017 and the Champions League in 2019. But according to L’Equipe, Pochettino must oversee a selling spree in the January window before buying his top targets.

The 24-year-old has been frozen out by Jose Mourinho in north London this season, making just 11 appearances in all competitions for Spurs. Alli was an unused substitute in Spurs’ last two Premier League outings, with his most recent appearance coming in their Carabao Cup quarter-final win away at Stoke. However, it is unclear if Tottenham would sanction a January exit. As for Pochettino, the former Spurs chief is excited to finally return to management. “I would like to thank the club’s management for the trust they have placed in me,” Pochettino said upon his appointment. “As you know, this club has always held a special place in my heart. I have wonderful memories, especially of the unique atmosphere of the Parc des Princes. “I return to the club today with a lot of ambition and humility and am eager to work with some of the world’s most talented players. “This team has fantastic potential and my staff and I will do everything we can to get the best for Paris Saint-Germain in all competitions.” (SOURCE: Daily Star UK) SHOCKING!
