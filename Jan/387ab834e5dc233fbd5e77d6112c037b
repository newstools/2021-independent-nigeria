Tougher coronavirus measures could be implemented in coming weeks in view of the serious situation in Britain, Prime Minister Boris Johnson hinted in an interview on Sunday.“It may be that we need to do things in the next few weeks that will be tougher in many parts of the country,’’ Johnson said on the BBC’s “Andrew Marr Show”.He, however, didn’t specify what they could be.“I’m not going to speculate now about what they would be, but … clearly, school closures, which we had to do in March is one of those things,’’ Johnson said.The country’s tiered system based on infection levels is “probably about to get tougher even despite the roll-out of vaccines’’, added the premier.Opposition leader, Keir Starmer, said Johnson could no longer wait before imposing a tougher nationwide lockdown.
