The management of Lagos State University (LASU) has issued a release dissociating the university community from certain reports being sponsored by a group of individuals with insidious intention against the institution on some news media both social and traditional. The release signed Ademola Adekoya, the Coordinator, Centre for Information, Press and Public Relations (CIPPR) states that: The attention of Lagos State University Authority has been drawn to some falsehood, unfounded and unverified reports and stories being circulated on social media platforms and on the pages of some traditional media by individuals or a group of individuals who are NEITHER members of the University Community NOR members of our respected staff and students’ Unions. ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY. DON'T BE A VICTIM! Lagos State University’s records have clearly shown that none of the signatories to these unfounded stories is a member of staff of the University. To put the record straight, the University is proud of her world class students, legitimate members of staff (Teaching and Non – Teaching) and most importantly, the recognized students’ and staff unions and, their respective leaders who have been unrelenting, working tirelessly and highly supportive to the growth and development of our dear University.

Therefore, as a responsible and responsive Management that is more committed to pushing the frontiers of excellence on all fronts, we hereby dissociate the name of the University from impostors, claiming to be staff and students posting all forms of falsehood, write ups/reports/stories that had not been verified by the institution’s Authority. Finally, all well-meaning stakeholders are enjoined to always contact the university authority to verify relevant information before they believe or even proliferate such information.
