DON'T BE A VICTIM! On the Covid-19 pandemic, the cleric alleged: “Covid 19 was brought to Nigeria by our government. They invited the pandemic into this country and it eventually came. “During the first wave of Covid 19 across the world, there was no Covid 19 in Nige­ria but our government said it was here. During the lockdown when everyone was donating billions for the government, it was just fever that was affect­ing people and government was collecting money and sharing the money among themselves.”
