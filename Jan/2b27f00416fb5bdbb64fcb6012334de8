LAGOS – Five-time world champions Nigeria and three-time world champions Ghana headline the seven-team West African Football Union (WAFU B) Under-17 Tournament tak­ing place in Lome, Togo from Wednesday, January 5 to Wednesday, January 20, 2021. Nigeria’s Under-17 Boys, the Golden Eaglets will fly into Lome on Sunday (today) morning from Lagos, with a squad of 25 players who are expected to pick the ticket from the WAFU tournament to represent the region in this year’s CAF Under-17 Cup of Nations taking place in Mo­rocco. Pedigree, pride and career aspiration aside, the Eaglets are sure to derive some kind of vicarious motivation from the below-par outing of the Nigeria Under-20 Boys at the WAFU B U20 Tournament in Benin Republic last month.

Nigeria conquered the world in 1985, 1993, 2007, 2013 and 2015, and alongside Gha­na have dominated cadet foot­ball on the African continent, with Mali, Cote d’Ivoire and Senegal to be reckoned with as well on the basis of invest­ment and focus on youth de­velopment. The Eaglets’ first encoun­ter in Lome will be against the Ivorians, at the Stade Munici­pal on Wednesday from 4pm, and should serve as a pointer to how much the Eaglets are keen to conquer Africa again.
