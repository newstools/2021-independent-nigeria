BENIN – A Middle-aged man has abandoned his wife and three children in a Point of Sales shop at Oluku near Benin City, the Edo State capital. Reports had it that the man went to the POS shop with his wife and three children, gave his Automat­ed Teller Machine (ATM) Card to the female POS at­tendant and requested for the sum of Forty-Three Thousand Naira. Unfortunately, the trans­action did not go through; the man then pleaded with the POS attendant to give him the Forty-Three thou­sand naira (N43,000) to give to a customer waiting for him at home while his wife, Mrs. Faith David and the three children should wait behind until the ATM connection go through as an assurance that he would return swiftly.

Mrs. Faith who was in tears while speaking to journalists on Sunday at the police station appealed to kindhearted Nigerians to come to her aid by en­suring she leaves the police station with her kids. She wondered why her husband decided to use her and the children as collat­eral to take money from the POS shop.
