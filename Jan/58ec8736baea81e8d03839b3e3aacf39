Dr Gabriel Olowo, President, Aviation Roundtable (ART) has urged domestic airlines to consider merger due to the present rise in the COVID-19 pandemic in the country. Olowo gave the advice in a communique issued  by the General Manager, Accident Investigation Bureau (AIB), Mr Tunji Oketumbi in Lagos on Sunday. He said: “Looking at the sector, our airlines are not too strong. We have said it enough that they should merge.

According to him, we have been talking that we do not want airlines with two aircraft. “We want airlines with 30 aircraft and it is doable,’’ he said. (NAN)
