DUTSE – The election of the 39 members of the Jigawa State Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) into various positions has put to rest the lingering crises between the Lamido led-faction of the party and Aminu Ringim. Speaking ahead of the state congress and elections, the Chairman of the seven- man congress committee, Barr. Umar Hardo said most of the positions were unopposed, only a few ones are to be contested. The congress, which was held on Monday, at the Dutse Stadium had suffered series of postponement due to litigations by the Aminu Ibrahim Ringim faction against the later. The last setback was the court injunction preventing the Sule Lamido faction from continuing with the party’s local government congress. However, a high court sitting in Dutse presided over by Justice Musa Ubale had rescinded its earlier order restricting the Sule Lamido led-faction from conducting the local government and state congress elections.
