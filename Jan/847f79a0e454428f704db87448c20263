LAGOS – Amidst fear of the possible spread of Coronavirus, the management of the University of Lagos (UNILAG), on Friday, announced an indefinite shutdown of the institution’s guest house at the main campus, Akoka. The varsity spokesperson, Mrs. Olufadeke Akinleye, confirmed the development to DAILY INDEPENDENT during a telephone chat. Recall that the varsity within the last two weeks lost two distinguished scholars in the persons of Professor Oyewusi Ibidapo-Obe, the university former Vice-Chancellor and Prof. Duro Ajeyalemi, a former dean of the Faculty of Education and the pioneer registrar of the Joint Universities Preliminary Examination Board (JUPEB).

Dr Dele Ashiru, Chairman, Academic Staff Union of Universities (ASUU), UNILAG chapter, had earlier in a chat told DAILY INDEPENDENT, that the union was not opposed to contact tracing and other measures to ensure the safety of other members of the university community.
