A Twitter account apparently representing Kataib Hezbollah, an Iran-backed militia based in Iraq that is US-designated terrorist organization, was suspended Wednesday hours after offering “training and advice” for prospective militants in the US. Joyce Karam, Senior Correspondent at the UAE-based newspaper The National, tweeted Wednesday morning a screenshot of the Kataib Hezbollah post, with a translation: “In God’s name … Security consultants for Islamic Resistance [Hezbollah] are up and ready to offer direct and indirect training and advice for liberation movements inside the non-United States of America and will assign special locations for that,” the group’s post read.

The account belonged to Abu Ali al-Askari, a senior leader of the Iran-funded paramilitary group, one of the most powerful in Iraq. Its former head and founder, Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, was killed in a US drone strike in Jan. 2020, along with Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps head Qassem Soleimani. Several hours after Karam’s tweet-thread about the account, which had over 18,000 followers, it had been suspended — although another account was still active on the messaging platform Telegram, where users can broadcast public channels. Twitter did not respond to a request for comment.
