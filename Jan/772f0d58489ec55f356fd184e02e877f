The family of a flight attendant who was the first victim to be identified after last week’s crash of an Indonesian passenger jet is preparing to bury his remains on Thursday. Police identified Okky Bisma, 29, as a victim of Saturday’s crash of a Sriwijaya Air Boeing 737-500 after matching his fingerprints with ones found in government records on Monday. “He will be buried today,” said the victim’s father, Supeno Kiswanto.
