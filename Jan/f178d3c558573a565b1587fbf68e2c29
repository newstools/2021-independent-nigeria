Emma Wike, President, Nigerian Institution of Estate Surveyors and Valuers, has urged the government to provide enabling environment for the housing industry to do well. I donâ€™t support the view that government should go into direct construction of houses but it should encourage the private sector to take on that while it creates enabling environment. The government should always meet and consult with the professionals for advice. The government at all levels, should embark on valuing their assets with the purpose of payment of tax. The government should diversify from oil and gas to other sectors of the economy. I am convinced that if we diversify, it will boost the economy enormously.
