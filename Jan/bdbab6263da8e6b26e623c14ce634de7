ABAKAIKI – Governor David Umahi of Ebonyi State says the re­cent convocation of meeting of some leaders of the South-East geo- po­litical zone at Igbere, Abia State, over agitation for zon­ing of Nigeria’s presidential ticket to the region was a vindication of his bid. He said this at a commu­niqué issued by some prom­inent Igbo leaders in Igbere parley, urging all political parties to zone their 2023 presidential ticket to the South-East as a queue up to his clamour, which was earlier seriously attacked. Umahi, in a statement through his Special Assis­tant on Media and Publicity, Francis Nwaze, explained that his joining the All Pro­gressives Congress (APC) has sent strong message that the South-East zone can no longer be taken for a ride and that the zone was ready and willing to take its destiny by its hands in the nation’s polity. ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY. DON'T BE A VICTIM! Recall that Umahi had on November 19, 2020, at a rally attended by the Na­tional leadership of the APC led by its Caretaker Chairman and Governor of Yobe State, Mai Mala Buni, joined the ruling APC. He stated: “The reason for the bold step was due to the age-long neglect of the South-East zone by the PDP despite the fact that one of its foremost founding mem­bers His Excellency, the for­mer Vice-President of Ni­geria, Dr. Alex Ekwueme, was from the zone. Because of the integrity of Dr. Ekwueme, the Igbos of the South-East zone embraced wholly the PDP and rallied round it since the return to Democracy in 1999. Despite supporting other regions to take their shots to the number-one plum job in the federation, the zone has always been relegated to the background when it comes to consideration for the presidential slot.”
