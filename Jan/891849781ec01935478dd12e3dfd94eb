Umuahia- Political fireworks, attacks and counter attacks broke out this weekend between the camp of former governor of Abia State and Chief Whip of the Senate, Sen Orji Uzor Kalu and the camp of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) over last week’s hosting of the Igbo leaders to discuss the election of Nigerian President of South East extraction in 2023. At the meeting held at the Camp Neya, Igbere, Bende LGA of Abia State, Kalu’s country home, about 2,000 PDP members were alleged to have decamped to the All Progressives Congress (APC), Kalu’s party. Kalu served as a two time governor of Abia State from 1999 to 2007 under the PDP before his defection to APC in 2018.

But in a swift reaction to the claim, the Publicity Secretary of PDP in the state, Chief Fabian Nwankwo calls it “hogwash”, asking rhetorically, “how a residence of Kalu that cannot contain about 50 persons suddenly accommodate 2,000 persons?” “Ignore the claim”, he counseled. However, Senator Orji Uzor kalu, through his Media Adviser (South East), Mr Maduka Okoro, said Nwankwo “goofed” because of some little portage from his master’s table.
