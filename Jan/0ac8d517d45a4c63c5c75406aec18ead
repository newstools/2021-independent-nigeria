Iran’s military on Tuesday launched a two-day campaign of aerial drills involving combat and surveillance unmanned aircraft, as well as “suicide drones” designed to obliterate targets from above, state media reported. Hundreds of combat drones are taking part in the “first major drone exercise” held by the Iranian army in central Semnan province, state-controlled news agency IRNA reported. “The exercise will include tracing and destroying air targets by means of air-to-air missiles and will also include destroying targets on the ground by means of bombs and precision missiles,” the news service reported, citing Rear Adm. Mahmoud Mousavi, deputy commander of the army. ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY. DON'T BE A VICTIM! Iran has previously conducted drills employing military drones, according to the Associated Press, but these exercises were launched days after the one-year anniversary of the US killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who died in a US drone airstrike at Baghdad International Airport. As part of the two-day exercises, Mousavi said suicide drones will be tested extensively. A US official told Reuters last year that the unmanned aircraft can carry out a “kamikaze” mission when packed with explosives and flown directly into a target.

Since the killing of Soleimani, US officials have feared a retaliatory attack.
