BENIN – As the Edo chapter of the Nigeria Union of Teachers (NUT) is galvanizing its members to embark on an in­definite strike action over ir­reconcilable differences with the government, the Union weekend directed members to shun enrollment into the state government’s contribu­tory pension scheme. This directive is coming ahead of the scheduled Jan­uary 18, resumption by all public and private primary and post primary institutions for a second term of the 2021 academic session. A statement titled, “forceful enrollment into contributory pension scheme”, signed and made available to newsmen in Benin City, by Moni Mike Modesty Itua, Assistant Gen­eral Secretary of the union on Sunday stated that the direc­tive to NUT members remain in force until the union direct­ed otherwise.

Itua said the decision for public primary school teach­ers not to enroll into the con­tributory pension scheme was a follow-up to the resolu­tion of the State Wing Exec­utive Council (SWEC) of the union at its last meeting held on the 29th of December, 2020. The state wing of NUT in that meeting issued a 21- day strike notice to the state government over failure to meet its 10-point demands bordering on poor conditions of service, non-payment of outstanding financial entitle­ments among others.

He opined that the direc­tive to primary school teach­ers not to fill any pension doc­ument became inevitable as a result of the failure of the state government to address two issues by the union as re­gards to the scheme.
