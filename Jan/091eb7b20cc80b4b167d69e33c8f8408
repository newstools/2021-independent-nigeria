House Speaker Nancy Pelosi speaks to reporters a day after supporters of US President Donald Trump occupied the Capitol. ReutersSoraya EbrahimiSoraya EbrahimiJanuary 11, 2021The House could vote on impeaching President Donald Trump as soon as Tuesday, but hold off for months on sending the process to the Senate, and so avoid triggering an immediate trial, a senior Democratic lawmaker said.House Majority Whip James Clyburn said the Democratic leadership is “working hard” on an article of impeachment demonstrating that Trump is “unqualified to be president.”“I think that will come probably Tuesday and maybe Wednesday,” Clyburn said on Fox News Sunday when asked whether House Democrats will vote on impeachment this week.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has called on Mr Trump to resign over Wednesday’s violent storming of the Capitol, and she raised the prospect of impeachment unless he leaves office immediately. Five people died in the attack, including a police officer, after Trump supporters broke through security barriers and rampaged through the building, forcing lawmakers to evacuate while they were counting Electoral College votes. Yet Ms Pelosi is moving cautiously even as she faces pressure from her caucus to hold Mr Trump accountable by impeaching him for a second time. President-elect Joe Biden has made it clear he wants the party to focus on his agenda and on fighting the coronavirus rather than pursuing another impeachment.Clyburn suggested that any successful impeachment in the House – which is similar to an indictment – could be held by the House for 100 days or more to avoid derailing the beginning of the Biden administration. It’s ultimately a decision for Ms Pelosi, the South Carolina Democrat said on CNN’s “State of the Union.”“Let’s give President-elect Biden the 100 days he needs to get his agenda off and running, and maybe we’ll send the articles some time after that,” Mr Clyburn said.Ms Pelosi has told lawmakers to be “prepared to return to Washington” this week, suggesting she is considering impeachment or another formal response to Mr Trump’s role encouraging his supporters who attacked the Capitol.At least 195 House Democrats have signed on to one of the impeachment articles, and some Republicans have said they believe Mr Trump conduct is impeachable, although they question how the process would play out with less than two weeks left in his term.In a letter to fellow Democrats Saturday, Ms Pelosi stopped short of saying she intended to move forward with impeachment or another process aimed at removing Mr Trump from office before his term expires on January 20, yet she insisted that he be held responsible in some fashion.“It is absolutely essential that those who perpetrated the assault on our democracy be held accountable,” she said in the letter released late Saturday. “There must be a recognition that this desecration was instigated by the president.”A small group of House Republicans who opposed GOP objections to Biden’s Electoral College victory asked the president-elect to persuade Ms Pelosi to back off impeaching Mr Trump. The lawmakers, led by Representative Ken Buck of Colorado, warned in a Saturday letter to Mr Biden that impeachment would inflame Mr Trump’s supporters and damage the incoming president’s efforts to unify the country.Ms Pelosi said in her letter that she’ll continue to meet with lawmakers and Constitutional experts, but added, “I urge you to be prepared to return to Washington this week.” On Friday, she said that she had told the Rules Committee to be ready to move forward with an impeachment case, but stopped short of saying it would be brought for a vote.For Democratic leaders there’s little risk in pressuring Mr Trump’s cabinet and Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to declare the president incapable of governing. But impeachment would put the spotlight on Mr Trump instead of on preparing for Mr Biden’s incoming administration. It could also mean a Senate impeachment trial during the first days of Mr Biden’s presidency, forcing the chamber to set aside other business, including confirming a new cabinet.Mr Biden, when asked Friday about impeaching Mr Trump, said that was a judgment for Congress to make. But he also appeared to suggest tapping the brakes on such a politically fraught move when there’s only a dozen days until his inauguration.“It’s important we get on with the business getting him out of office. The quickest way that that will happen is us being sworn in on the 20th,” Mr Biden said at a news conference in Wilmington, Delaware. “I am focused now on us taking control as president and vice president on the 20th, and to get our agenda moving as quickly as we can.”A group of House Democrats plans to unveil on Monday an Article of Impeachment, according to Representative Ted Lieu of California.“We will introduce the Article of Impeachment this Monday during the House’s pro forma session,” Mr Lieu said on Twitter.The text of the proposed impeachment resolution includes a single article accusing President Trump of “Incitement of Insurrection” and says he engaged in high crimes and misdemeanours by “wilfully inciting violence against the government of the United States” in connection with the storming of the Capitol.Any attempt to impeach Mr Trump would be running up against the calendar as well as against divisions among Republicans over how to contain the president during his final days in office. The House would have just days to act before Biden’s inauguration, and it’s not clear that the Senate could move ahead with a trial within a week. Convicting Mr Trump would require support from a significant number of GOP senators.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who’s stayed mum on any next steps regarding Mr Trump, sent a memo to GOP senators late Friday outlining the timetable for any impeachment trial. It said that the Senate is in recess and it would require unanimous consent in the chamber to act on any impeachment trial before January 19. A trial would not begin until Mr Trump’s term expired and then would require the Senate to remain in session daily until a verdict is rendered.
