ABUJA- The National Hajj Commission of Nigeria, (NAHCON), has expressed optimism of a possible Hajj exercise in 2021, following the news of Saudi Arabia lifting its suspension on international travels. Recall that a travel ban was imposed by the Saudi government in 2020 leading to the cancellation of all Hajj related visas and the restriction of pilgrimage to locals and Muslims already residing in the kingdom. NAHCON, in reaction to the latest development via a statement signed by its Head, Public Affairs, Fatima Sanda Usara, said: “As a people of faith saddled with the responsibility of managing Hajj and Umrah travels from Nigeria, the news holds glad tidings for those hoping to embark on Hajj and Umrah from Nigeria.” ABUJA DOCTOR REVEALS HOW MOST NIGERIA MEN ARE NOW OVERCOMING TERRIBLE BEDROOM PERFORMANCE DUE TO THIS BRILLIANT DISCOVERY.

It said in the meantime, the Commission urges intending pilgrims, states and other Hajj and Umrah licensed operators to continue with normal preparations and registration while exercising patience until clear directives are released by Saudi Arabia. “While doing so, all intending pilgrims and state officials are reminded to observe COVID-19 protocols in order to curtail the spread of the pandemic especially under this second wave.” “The Commission, the Presidential Task Force on COVID-19 and Federal Ministry of Health represented by NAHCON’s board member representing the Ministry, Pham Zainab Ujudud Shariff are already mapping out strategic guidelines on COVID-19 preventive measures relative to safeguarding Nigerian pilgrims from harm during large gatherings customary to Hajj preparations.” “At this juncture, NAHCON also wishes to remind all intending pilgrims for Hajj that registration for 2021 Hajj will continue on the normal platform on e-Hajj portals under state pilgrims’ boards/agencies /commissions, while those wishing to pay against 2022 and beyond are advised to utilize the Hajj Savings Scheme platform,” the statement added.
