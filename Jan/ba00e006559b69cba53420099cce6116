BENIN – Dr. Tony Azeigbemi, Chair­man, Edo State chapter of the Peoples Democratic Par­ty (PDP), has stated that the Benin High Court ruling on Wednesday which disqualified Pastor Osagie Ize-Iyamu’s run­ning mate, Mallam Gani Audu of the All Progressives Con­gress (APC) in the Edo State September 19, 2020, guberna­torial election, means nothing to the PDP led administration of Gov. Godwin Obaseki of the state. Dr. Aiziegbemin made the clarification in a chat with newsmen in Benin. According to Aziegbemi, “You will recall that the Edo State chairman of the All Progressives Congress (APC), Barr. Anselm Ojezua, had warned Edo people and Ni­gerians that the APC does not have a candidate for the Sep­tember 19, 2020, gubernatorial election.

We don’t have the judgment yet, until we see the judgment before we can say what the judge used in arriving at this conclusion.

So, it doesn’t mean anything to us. The law has just taken its course. Are we surprised, no? Did we expect it to come, yes? “Edo people have rightly taken that decision to vote for His Excellency, Godwin Obase­ki, who was our candidate during the election.” Azeigbemin charged Edo people to continue to support the administration of Gover­nor Godwin Obaseki to enable the governor concentrate on his efforts to move the state to the next level of development.
