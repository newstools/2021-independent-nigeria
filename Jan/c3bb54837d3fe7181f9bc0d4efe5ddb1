Vietnam will receive at least 30 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccine developed by AstraZeneca with Oxford University this year, a senior health official said on Monday. Addressing a news conference in the capital Hanoi, Deputy Health Minister Truong Quoc Cuong said the vaccines will be delivered “in phases through all four quarters of 2021,” daily Vietnam News reported. The shot requires two doses and will be administered with a four-week gap, meaning it will cater to around 15 million people in the country of over 95 million.
