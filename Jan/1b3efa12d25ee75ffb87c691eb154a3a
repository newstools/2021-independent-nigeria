From 126 million in December 2019, Internet subscriptions rose impressively 152.9 million as of October, 2020. The report indicated that broadband penetration maintained an upward swing to 45.93 percent in October 2020, up from 37.80 percent in 2019. Equally, Mobile Number Portability, MNP, service continued to offer wider options of service for telecoms consumers in 2020. In the year under review, 158,128 telecom consumers ported their lines between January-October 2020 as against over 120,000 lines that were ported in 2019… The report stated that the increase in MNP service usage was due to increased public education and awareness by the commission’s head office and its zonal offices, as they intensified awareness on the availability, usage and benefits of MNP across geo-political zones. Mobile number portability is a service introduced by NCC on mobile networks which allows telecoms consumers to switch from their current network to another preferred network, without changing their mobile number, when they feel a need to do so. The commission was able to successfully resolve over 98 percent of the total consumer complaints received from telecoms consumers via the NCC Toll-Free Number 622, NCC Consumer Portal, social media platforms and written complaints. Subscriptions by telecoms consumers to the NCC’s Do-Not-Disturb (DND) 2442 service reached over 30 million in 2020 compared with 22 million in 2019.
