The Libyan Interior Minister of the Government of National Accord (GNA), Fathi Bachagha, on Wednesday welcomed the Dutch Ambassador to Libya, Lars Tomers, back to the Embassy in Tripoli. Most diplomatic missions left Tripoli by 2014 due to the deteriorating security situation, but in recent years, many of them have resumed work again following the improvement of the situation. “We will continue to cooperate together in the fight against corruption, terrorism and organised crime,” Mr Bachagha said in a tweet published on Wednesday after meeting Mr. Tomers.
