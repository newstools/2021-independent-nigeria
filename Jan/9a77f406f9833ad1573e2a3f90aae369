LAGOS – Nigeria’s oil and gas logis­tics giant, Intels Nigeria Limited, on Tuesday, dis­missed claims by the for­mer Vice-President, Atiku Abubakar that its opera­tions are hindered by po­litical influences from the present government. Recall that on Monday, Intels announced that it had severed ties with its former shareholder, Alhaji Atiku Abubakar, after the latter, sold his interests in Intels’ parent company, Orlean Invest Holding, through a series of trans­actions executed through Guernsey Trust, in deals that began in December 2018 and concluded in 2020. However, Atiku, who confirmed his divestment from the company, blamed President Muhammadu Buhari’s administration of trying to destroy the com­pany because of political differences.
