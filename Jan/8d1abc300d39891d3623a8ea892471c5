OWERRI  – Determined to move Imo State forward, the state government has put arrangements on ground for new contractors to take over the construction of some roads. The state government also believes that it is better to work with Development Partners who have interest of the government and people of the state at heart and are willing to make sacrifices to help the state move forward than contractors who are only interested in making money. Ralph Nwosu, Imo State Commissioner for Works, disclosed that some contracts have already been revoked because some of the contractors did not show passion to work for the state, assuring that a new contractor to take over the construction of Nekede-lhiagwa Road would soon be named.

According to him, there are a total of 49 ongoing road construction projects in the state just as he said 28 were inherited from the previous government while the present government awarded others for strategic purposes. “Governor Uzodimma allowed the contractors already handling road projects in the state to continue but some of them did not show passion to work for the state, reasons their contracts were terminated.

That is why we said we are not ready to work with them” Nwosu stated. “If you are our development partners, you should be ready to work for us and we pay you at the end of the day. We can only owe. Everybody is owing. Even American government owes. Nigerian government is also owing. So, if Imo State Government is also owing you a little money which we know we will pay, it should not be a big deal”
