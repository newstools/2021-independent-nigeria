Recall that a political pres­sure group, under the umbrella of South-East for President 2023 while on a visit to Ohuabunwa at his country-home in Aro­chukwu in Abia State where the group’s National Coordina­tor, Okechukwu Obioha, called on the chairman of the Nigeria Economic Summit to heed to the calls to contest for the office of the Nigeria President. Responding to the group’s call, Ohuabunwa assured the group that he will heed to their call to run for the pres­idential election in 2023.
