Inter Milan have no intention of accepting offers for right wing-back Achraf Hakimi this summer, according to an Italian media report today. As per CalcioMercato.com, for the first time in many years Inter have seven players worth at least €50 million in Romelu Lukaku, Lautaro Martinez, Nicolo Barella, Milan Skriniar, Stefan de Vrij, Alessandro Bastoni and Hakimi. Hakimi is considered the least expendable of all seven, not least because it would be difficult for Inter to make a considerable profit from selling him, having only signed the Moroccan from Real Madrid for €40 million last summer.
