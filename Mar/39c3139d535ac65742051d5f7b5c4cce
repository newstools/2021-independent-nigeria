LAGOS – The Ikeja Division Empower­ment Forum, a Lagos indige­nous group, has urged all its members to always display diligence and patriotism in their service to the state and humanity. Jamiu Odewale Alonge, the group’s information and strategic communications of­ficer, said the statement was contained in an address made by Adejoke Apena, head of the celebration committee, during a ceremony to honour indi­genes of the area who have dis­tinguished themselves through diligence and patriotism and thus made the area proud. Apena charged all and sun­dry to ensure they display and exhibit due diligence and patri­otism, that is worth emulating to serve as encouragement, guide and enthusiasm for the upcoming children and indi­genes of the area.
