Somali National Army (SNA) elite forces, on Monday, killed an al-Shabab militant and foiled a terror attack during sting operations in the southern region. The SNA said its forces also blew up a vehicle laden with explosives in Toratorow, an agricultural town in the Lower Shabelle region. The army said the vehicle laden with explosives was en-route to the Somali capital, Mogadishu and the militants wanted to use it to carry out attacks on unspecified locations in the restive city.
