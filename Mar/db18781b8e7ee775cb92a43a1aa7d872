Kola Adeneye, Captain of Abeokuta Golf Club (AGC) has highlighted what made the club’s golf course special to golfers and standout from other courses in the country. The Captain described the course as a unique one with regards to its challeng­ing topography full of ups and downs; a round of golf session on the course would have translated to a 10 kilome­ters distance of walk which is very good for your health. The course is located in a serene environment, just be­hind the State’s government secretariat, which gives golf­ers a sense of security be­cause the course is situated in a secured environment and in an ambience devoid of noise or any city life interference.
