NNEWI – Worried by the wave of crime in the country, Honorable On­yebuchi Offor, the member representing Ekwusigo Con­stituency in the Anambra State House of Assembly, has solicited support for the Nige­ria police to enable it extend services to remote places in the state and the country as a whole. Offor who is the House Committee Chairman on Police Affairs, Security and Boundary Matters observed that since the EndSARS pro­test which was hijacked by hoodlums the police had been unable to penetrate remote areas of Anambra State and some parts of the country to combat crime due to lack of vehicles and other logistics. Offor stated this in an interview with DAILY IN­DEPENDENT at Oraifite, yesterday. HOW NIGERIAN MEN CAN NOW NATURALLY STOP PREMATURE EJACULATION, LOW SPERM COUNT AND OTHER MEN'S SEXUAL NEEDS.

The lawmaker said the police had been badly devas­tated and handicapped since end of the violent protests and could no longer enter the distant areas and villag­es which were prone to crime and other areas which usu­ally form part of criminal hideouts to perform their duty due to lack of vehicles and other logistics. He said the police lost ve­hicles, arms and ammuni­tion needed to combat crime during the protests as the hoodlums burnt down police facilities and patrol vehicles across the country and carted away arms and ammunition among other things.
