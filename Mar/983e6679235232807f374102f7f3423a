AWKA – Mr. Paul Orajiaka a native of Azia in Ihiala Local Govern­ment Area of Anambra State has said that he would create jobs for Anambra citizens if he becomes the next governor of the state. Orajiaka, who is one of the aspirants jostling for the ticket of the All Progressive Congress (APC) for the November 6, 2021 governorship election, said job and wealth creation was para­mount responsibilities that he would pursue vigorously for the betterment of the people. He said, “job creation is not something you leave to the gov­ernment alone; the government has to be an enabler for the pri­vatesectortocomeinandinvest. So the question is what are we going to do as a government to bring the private sector to come in and invest in Anambra State? HOW NIGERIAN MEN CAN NOW NATURALLY STOP PREMATURE EJACULATION, LOW SPERM COUNT AND OTHER MEN'S SEXUAL NEEDS. MADAM ALWAYS WANTS IT BIGGER, STRONGER AND LONG-LASTING!!! “Anambra has a lot of di­aspora communities overseas who are itching to bring in busi­nesses into the country and as a government, we want to attract these people to come in and cre­ate jobs for our people. “Apart from the diaspora communities, if you go to Ag­bara in Ogun State you see the level of industries the Igbos are setting up. Our plan is to bring in a lot of incentives that would attract Anambra industrialists to come in and set up factories that would create the jobs.”
