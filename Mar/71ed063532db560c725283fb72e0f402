Abdul Samad Rabiu, a phlanthropist and industrialist, has donated N200 million to Sokoto State University towards the construction of an ICT Faculty Building. This donation will support the university’s quest to become one of Nigeria’s best universities in the ICT space. According to Rabiu, Sokoto State is host to three of BUA Cement’s factories and over the years, the state had played a huge role in the growth and success of the company, therefore it is also of critical importance that BUA supports the development of talent in future-proof industries for the state such as ICT, research and education. This donation was announced during the university’s 2021 convocation ceremony in Sokoto where Rabiu alongside two others – His Highness, The Emir of Dutse, Alhaji (Dr.) Nuhu Muhammad Sanusi and the Late Alhaji Umaru Ali Shinkafi, were conferred with Honorary Doctorate Degrees for their contributions towards the development of Sokoto State and Nigeria in various fields.
