ABUJA – The appointment of former governor of Ekiti State, Ayo­dele Fayose as the Chairman of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) South-South zonal congress has received severe criticism from party stakeholders. This is even as a PDP group, under the aegis of South-South Youth Van­guard, condemned the ap­pointment, on the excuse that Fayose had not put his house in order. The National Work­ing Committee (NWC) of the party had last week appointed Fayose as the Chairman of the electoral committee to conduct zon­al congress for the purpose of electing zonal executive officers and national ex-of­ficio members for the south-south zone.
