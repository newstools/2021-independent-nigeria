The National Inland Waterways Authority (NIWA) has engaged Akewa Colmar Terminal Limited (ACTL) to move containers from Lagos Ports to Onitsha River Port via Burutu Port in Delta State. The deal according to NIWA is aimed at not only decongesting the Lagos Ports, but also to ensure that the Onitsha River Port becomes functional.
