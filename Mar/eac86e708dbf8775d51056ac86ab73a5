The Special Adviser noted that with its frequent updates on security events, the ministry had broken a longstanding taboo of making security information “classified”. “This reflects both a commitment to transparency and the strength of the relationship the ministry has built with security agencies who trust it to responsibly handle security data,’’ he added. The ministry, he stated, has itself become a consistent source of information to the security agencies through its “Operations Room” which is open 24 hours to receive reports from citizens. (NAN)
