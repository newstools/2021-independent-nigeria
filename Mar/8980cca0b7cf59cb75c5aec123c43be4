LAGOS – Justice Abimbola Awogboro of the Federal High Court, Yenagoa, Wednesday, urged journalists to ensure they verify facts before rushing to press, saying they owe a duty to uphold the ethics of their profession. The Judge gave the advice while ruling in a case filed by the Department of State Se­curity upon a complaint by the Kogi State Government against a Bayelsa based blog­ger, Saint Mienpamo Onit­sha over a false publication by the latter that the former spent N7billion to construct a COVID-19 isolation centre. Shocked by the falsehood in the publication, the Kogi State Government reported the blogger to the Depart­ment of State Security which arrested and charged the Blogger to Court.

However, after a public apology by the blogger, the Kogi State Governor decided to pardon him by withdraw­ing the case against him Justice Awogboro said oth­er journalists in the country should learn from the travails of the blogger and play ac­cording to the rules of their profession.
