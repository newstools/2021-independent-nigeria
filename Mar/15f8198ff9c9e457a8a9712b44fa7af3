LAGOS – Prophet T.B Joshua, the global overseer of the Synagogue Church of all Nations (SCOAN) has urged Nigerians to coop­erate with the Federal Govern­ment on the use of COVID-19 vaccines currently being ad­ministrated on the citizens. Speaking at the 15th anni­versary of Emmanuel TV, the cleric reiterated his earlier stand on the need for Nige­rians to support the govern­ments at all levels to ensure that the Coronavirus pan­demic is checked and possibly eradicated. On the global situation, Prophet Joshua said: “I have received thousands of emails on the COVID-19 vaccines from different parts of the word.

However, my belief is that our governments are only trying to look for a way out of this very challeng­ing situation, although there may be bad faith in certain quarters,” he acknowledged. “Many people have com­plained of some negative reactions. But, this is always the case with vaccines of this nature. At this time, our gov­ernments need our support and our cooperation because the world is in a dilemma,” he stated.
