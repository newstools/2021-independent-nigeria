US President Joe Biden on Monday called Pope Francis’s visit to Iraq a symbol of hope for the entire world, according to a White House statement. “Pope Francis’ visit was a historic and welcome first for the country. It sent an important message, as Pope Francis said himself, that ‘fraternity is more durable than fratricide, that hope is more powerful than death, that peace more powerful than war’,” Biden said. The president called Iraq as “home to one of the oldest and most diverse Christian communities in the world.” HOW NIGERIAN MEN CAN NOW NATURALLY STOP PREMATURE EJACULATION, LOW SPERM COUNT AND OTHER MEN'S SEXUAL NEEDS.

Biden congratulated the government and people of Iraq for planning the Pope’s visit, and said he continues to admire Pope Francis for his commitment to promoting religious tolerance, the common bonds of humanity, and interfaith understanding.
