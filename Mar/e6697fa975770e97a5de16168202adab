NNEWI – Okey Okoye, the mem­ber representing Aguata 11 Constituency in the Anambra State House of Assembly, has said the rel­ative peace between the Assembly and the execu­tive in Anambra State was important for development of the state. He said being at peace with the executive did not mean that the Assembly was rubber stamp to the executive, adding that the Anambra Assembly would not want to raise un­necessary issues which would create tension in the state in order not to be branded rubber stamp of the executive. Okoye stated this in an in­terview with Daily Indepen­dent at Isuofia, Aguata Local Government Area of Anam­bra State, yesterday shortly after meeting with members of Anambra State Equity Al­liance in the area.

We have to protect what we have. We have to protect the develop­ment of Anambra State.
