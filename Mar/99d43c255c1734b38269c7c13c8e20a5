According to the minister, there was a mix up with PPPRA’s announcement, adding that, it had reversed itself. “PPPRA announcement was a mixed-up,. The agency has already reversed its position,” Sylva said. The minister maintained that the PMS price would not be increased now until govenmenrt’s discussions with labour and other stakeholders are concluded. “The government position has not changed. What this administration wants to bequeath as a legacy to Nigerians is a deregulated downstream. “We have never changed that position but can’t happen without consultations with stakeholders . You know we announced the deregulation last year as part of our discussion with labour. We decided to step back a little and continue the conversation with labour and other stakeholders. “Discussion is still ongoing and that is why we have not increased price. There is no plan to increase petro price at all until we conclude those discussions with labour and other stakeholders,” he assured.
