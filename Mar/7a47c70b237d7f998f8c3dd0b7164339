He pointed out that security personnel in the state were inadequate and as such personnel posted in the state were not enough to handle the security challenges in the state. Governor Ortom further stated that security matters do not require only the intervention of security personnel, but that the citizenry also offer information for the personnel to act on. According to him, the perpetrators of the crimes were living among the people and he wondered why they were shielding the criminals. He therefore called on stakeholders in the state to assist the government in providing intelligence that would help security in tackling security challenges in the state. However, retired Compol Aghanya had noted that from his investigations he deduced that it may not be a case of assassination, but that of armed robbery, adding that robbers may have broken into the house and on her return, they may have panicked and killed his wife. The CP stated that it was not plausible for him to have left the state, as Compol after about 18 years for someone to come looking for him, on a revenge mission. It could be recalled that some yet to be identified persons may have murdered Mrs Aghanya in her residence behind Kismet Hotel, located off David Mark bye-pass, Makurdi.
