Ardova Plc, an indigenous en­ergy group, has announced a decline in profit after tax to the tune of 52.6% to N1. 8billion for the audited financial year ended December 31, 2020. The company, however, recorded a 3.1% growth in revenue in the review financial period to N181.9billion from N176.5billion in the preceding finan­cial year. Ardova Plc operates majorly in the downstream sector of the Nigeria’s oil and gas industry, but has diversi­fied its businesses into other sectors of the energy value chain.

Revenue growth was driven by increased sales of petroleum prod­ucts, which grew by 3.4% year-on-year (y/y) in FY-2020. Cost of sales grew at a slower pace, up 2.6% y/y to N169.7billion in FY-2020. As a result, gross profit recorded a decent 12.1% y/y growth to print at N12.1billion in FY-2020. However, operating income dropped by 16.0% y/y to N4.1bil­lion, largely driven by the 2019 high base due to gain on disposed assets recorded. As such, Profit before tax and Profit after tax declined by 37.6% and 52.6%, to N2.9billion and N1.8bil­lion, respectively, in the period under review. Earnings per Share (EPS) fell 52% to N1.4 per share in FY-2020. The firm proposed a dividend of N0.19 per share. Analysts at United Capital noted that the economic lockdown in the review period brought about by the Covid-19 pandemic hampered fuel demand in Nigeria which also af­fected the activities of Ardova Plc. “However, due to the price hikes and increased market share, Ardova Plc reported a relatively strong year. Total revenue grew by 3.1% in 2020, primar­ily driven by growth in sales of fuel products, which grew by 3.4% y/y to N164.4billion in FY-2020 from N159. 2billion in FY-2019. Lubricant sales fell by 1.6% y/y from N17.2billion in FY-2020 to N16.9billion in FY-2019. So­lar system business performed poor­ly as it recorded a 74.4% y/y decline in revenue to print at N10.0million in FY-2020 from N39.0million in FY- 2019. At the company’s FY-2020 an­alyst presentation, it stated that it’s rising sales numbers were due to its increased market share to become the market leader, citing data from Nige­ria’s Major Oil marketing association (MOMAN).” European Union, AFDEC Partner To Empower Female Entrepreneurs In Nigeria SavingsOur Target Is To Achieve A Balance Sheet Size Of N1.2trn In 2022 – Bello Cost of sales printed higher at N169.7billion in FY-2020 from N165. 2billion in FY-2019, representing a 2.6% y/y growth. The growth in cost of sales was mainly driven by an in­crease in petroleum product costs, which grew 3.0% y/y to N157.0bil­lion in FY-2020 from N152.3billion in FY-2019. In addition, the company booked N25.0millio in direct costs due to the unveiling of its haulage busi­ness as part of its efforts to bolster operating efficiency. Consequently, gross margins rose 3bps to 6.7% y/y. We note that the marginal improve­ment in gross margin was driven by the higher margins in its Lubricant (26.2%) segment compared to Petrol or PMS (4.2%). Profit margins in the PMS segment remained low, as the firm does not hold any wholesaler privileges, which would have allowed for improved margins. Analysts not­ed that Ardova’s drive to increase its market share in the lubricant market by signing an agreement with Shell lubricant is laudable as it looks to support its more profitable segment. Overall, operating expenses fell 11.7% y/y in FY-2020 due to a 16.6% y/y de­cline in administrative expenses to N7.3billion. Ardova’s total assets in the peri­od under review grew 10.4% to N68. 4billion, mainly due to increases in building under construction, as the company continues to expand on its base (retail stations). Hence, PPE rose 49.0% to N15.2billion in the period. The company extended its debt/bor­rowing lines in the period under re­view, as total debt grew 121.1% y/y to N11.8billion. However, finance costs fell by -68.9% though the average cost of borrowing settled at 10.5% main­ly because the bulk of the borrowing was accessed via overdraft facilities. At 10.5%, Ardova’s cost of borrowing is well above discount rates on com­mercial papers which tumbled to a record low in 2020, with several large corporates issuing capital at sub-3%. “As such, we opine that ARDOVA would benefit from a capital market program to optimize its funding cost, considering that the yield environ­ment remains relatively friendly for private sector capital raise. Interest coverage was stronger at 3.9x in FY- 2020 vs. 1.5x in FY-2019, respectively. Net cash flows from operations print­ed at N4.8bn in FY-2020, from N4.7bn in FY-2019,” United Capital noted in its report on the company. Analysts’ outlook for Ardova remains moderate, considering the firm’s cost improvement and effi­ciency management drive observed in recent quarters; operating margin and profit before tax margin were up 100bps and 47bps y/y, respectively, due to a 166bps moderation in op­erating costs y/y (adjusting for gain on assets in 2019). However, due to the continued uncertainty around the adjustment of Petrol (PMS) prices, we have also tempered our optimism around full price recov­ery. Although the FGN made efforts to partially deregulate and moved away from its regulated pricing regime in 2020, recent dynamics in the market points to another epi­sode of policy backflip. According to the PPPRA pricing framework, the pump price of PMS should be in the range of N209-N212 per litre, considering the rising spot FOB Rot­terdam prices The FX challenges and the continuation of the NNPC direct sale; direct purchase program (DSDP) means the NNPC through the PPMC remains the sole importer of PMS.
