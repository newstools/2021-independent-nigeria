Lagos- A group, Coalition of Aworis and Descendants (CANDID) has opposed a bill by the Lagos State House Assembly proposing a further divide and marginalization of the Aworis of the state. This was the conclusion reached by CANDID, the group representing Awori indigenes living outside the shores of Nigeria, at the end of a general meeting held recently. The group in a statement signed by Mr. Jeleel Agbedina, Assistant General Secretary stated, “The Coalition of Aworis and Descendants (CANDID) objects to the proposed Lagos State Administrative (establishment) Bill, 2021 (HAB #23) which has enjoyed multiple readings on the floor of the house.

MADAM ALWAYS WANTS IT BIGGER, STRONGER AND LONG-LASTING!!! “The said bill seeks to further delineate the Administrative Divisions of Lagos State – IBILE as created in May 1968 under Administrative Divisions (Establishment) Edict No. 3 of April 1968.” “As proposed, the bill intends to absorb majority Awori local government regions of Alimosho, Kosofe, and Eti-Osa into administrative divisions with tribes of unique socio-cultural and political values different from those of the Aworis as a group.” Ooni, Princess Ademiluyi Empower Women With Free Adire Making Training Ogun Monarch Laments Herdsmen’s Attacks, Killings In His Domain CANDID, in the statement, argued that absorbing the “Aworis into the socio-culturally unique administrative divisions of Badagry, Epe and Ikorodu is synonymous with modern-day enslavement resulting in a potential loss of identity of the Awori over time.” The group demanded, “Rather than a bill to further denigrate the Aworis, CANDID recommends and challenge the LAHA to come up with one that will uphold and enhance Awori identity with Lagos State. Such Bill should recognize the participation, dedication and sacrifices of Aworis towards a peaceful and progressive Lagos State. “CANDID also suggests a reform of the existing administrative divisions to recognize majority tribes such as the Aworis in its nomenclature,” CANDID added.
