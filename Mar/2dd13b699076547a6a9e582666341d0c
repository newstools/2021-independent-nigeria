LAGOS – The Centre for Anti-Cor­ruption and Open Leader­ship (CACOL) has hailed the Supreme Court’s ruling upholding the 10 years’ im­prisonment of former Pla­teau State governor, Joshua Dariye, upon his conviction for criminal breach of trust. Mr. Debo Adeniran, CACOL’s Executive Chair­man, in a statement signed by Tola Oresanwo, the group’s Director of Admin­istration and Programmes, noted that Dariye, in his appeal, had prayed the Su­preme Court to upturn the November 16, 2018 judgment of the Court of Appeal, Abu­ja, which convicted him and sentenced him to 10 years imprisonment for diverting public funds estimated at N1. 162billion while he was the governor. The CACOL boss recalled that a three-man panel of the Court of Appeal, led by Justice Stephen Adah, in its decision, had upheld an earlier judgment by Justice Adebukola Banjoko of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT), de­livered on June 12, 2018.

He stated that the trial court had convicted Dariye on 15 counts relating to the offences of criminal breach of trust and criminal misap­propriation contained in the 23-count charge on which he was tried by the Economic and Financial Crimes Com­mission (EFCC). He also recalled that in upholding Dariye’s convic­tion, the Court of Appeal had noted that the prosecution, led by Rotimi Jacobs (SAN), effectively proved its alle­gation of criminal breach of trust and criminal mis­appropriation against the ex-governor.
