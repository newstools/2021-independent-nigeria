Nasarawa State on Monday in Lafia challenged its Fiscal Transparency, Accountability and Sustainability, (SFTAS), committee  to ensure that the state qualified for World Bank grant this year. The Deputy Governor, Dr Emmanuel Akabe, told the committee to develop a positive and result-oriented attitude to attain the objective. He expressed regret that Nasarawa State was not able to get World Bank grants because it did not meet one of the Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) of the bank.
