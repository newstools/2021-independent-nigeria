ABUJA – As part of activities com­memorating the Interna­tional Women’s Day 2021, an election monitoring group, the Centre For Transparency Advocacy (CTA), has advocated for more women participation in politics, so as to produce a female President or depu­ty in the 2023 general elec­tion. Executive Director of the Group, Faith Nwadishi, made the call on Tuesday while delivering a key note address at a stakeholders’ round table in commem­oration of International Women’s Day 2021, with the theme :#choose to chal­lenge. She used the recent election of Dr Okon­jo-Iweala as Director Gen­eral of the World Trade Organization to buttress her call, saying if a Ni­gerian woman can aspire to govern the global trade body, then Nigerian wom­en were ripe to lead the country either as Presi­dent or Vice President.
