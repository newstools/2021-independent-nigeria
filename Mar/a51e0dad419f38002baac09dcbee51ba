WARRI – The leaders of Augoye Media Team, who monitored the March 6 Delta Local Govern­ment Election across the three senatorial districts on Mon­day described the exercise as free, fair and credible. The group’s leaders, who visited James Augoye, the Del­ta State Works Commissioner, at Ugbokodo, who was at home to vote for all the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) can­didates, stated that “there was no voter-apathy as the turnout of voters was very impressive, even as they conducted them­selves in a peaceful manner, a sign of the fact that our democ­racy is taking root.” Augoye, while playing host to the leaders for their patriotic service, thanked the electorate for coming out en-masse to vote for all the PDP candidates.
