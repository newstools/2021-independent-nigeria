LAGOS – The UEFA Champions League return leg of round-of-16 clash between Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) and FC Barcelona at the Parc des Princes will be a her­culean task for the Spanish gi­ants who are trailing 1-4 after the emphatic first leg result at Camp Nou. Though, Barcelona have been a resurgent force this month and have enjoyed an excellent week both on and off the pitch, having stunned Sevilla with a brilliant come­back in the Copa del Rey last week, they will need to pull off a similar result in this match. PSG on the other hand have managed to recover from a slow start to their sea­son and will be intent on win­ning a treble in the coming months. The French cham­pions have kept clean sheets in their last three games and will be confident ahead of this tie.
