LAGOS – High cost of inputs, obnox­ious practices and pollution of the aquatic ecosystem have been identified as some of the barriers to the success of ar­tisanal fishing in the country. Abisola Olusanya, Lagos State Commissioner for Ag­riculture, stated this while speaking during the empow­erment and capacity building for artisanal fishing commu­nities in the state. She explained that the intervention arose from the concern that fish landings by fishermen have not been maximized, especially due to the high cost of fishing inputs and undesirable fishing prac­tices.

She noted that these prac­tices have resulted in low catches for the fishermen’s efforts, thereby translating to reduced income and a ru­ral-urban drift by younger fishermen seeking greener pastures. According to her, the state government has been empow­ering fishermen in the state with outboard engines, provi­sion of boats and nets, among others, to reduce the shuttle time during their fishing ac­tivities and support fishing operations in order to reverse this trend.
