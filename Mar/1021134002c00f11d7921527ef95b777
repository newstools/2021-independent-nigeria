LAGOS – The Lagos State Ministry of Transportation in collaboration with the Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Taskforce, carried out a special joint operation today to send a strong signal to dredging operators whose operations are impeding the free flow of traffic for residents bestriding Ado road in Ajah-Badore. CSP Shola Jejeloye, Chairman, Lagos State Environmental and Special Offences Taskforce, who led the operation, said, “The major purpose of this operation is to send a message to dredgers operating here with impunity, their operations is too close to the road which is causing untold hardship to commuters and motorists getting to their destinations on time. “The truck drivers conveying sand dredged from the waters here are recalcitrant, breaking traffic regulations and oftentimes found blocking the road against other motorists, who have to make do the narrow portion of the road left for them by these truck drivers.

He added that, “Commuters living on Ado road sometimes take about four hours to move from their homes to get to Ajah Jubilee bridge, which ordinarily should not take more than few minutes. This is not acceptable, so we have come to ask them to move their dredging operations away from here to places around Epe and other uninhabited places of the water.” CSP Jejeloye explained further that Ajah-Badore used to be a quiet unassuming village, but now a burgeoning settlement, with many businesses and professionals living there, and working in different parts of the state, stressing however that dredging activities carried out by more than 10 different companies is making life unbearable for the dwellers trying to commute to their different places of work and businesses on a daily basis.
