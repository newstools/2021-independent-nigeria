The coronavirus pandemic has throttled private consumption in Germany, with households spending five per cent less in price-adjusted terms than previous year, the Federal Statistical Office said on Monday. This was the sharpest decline since 1970 and differs fundamentally from consumer behaviour in the financial and economic crisis of 2008 to 2009 when private consumption fell less markedly and shored up the German economy. During the first half of the year in particular, spending fell in almost all areas. During the first lockdown, there was no spending on rail and air travel, nor did people spend in restaurants.

People only spent more money on food and drink. Over the year as a whole, spending on these items rose by 6.3 per cent.

The Federal Statistical Office suspects that the temporary lowering of the value-added tax (VAT) might also have played a role in this regard. (dpa/NAN)
