Senator Hadi Sirika, Minis­ter of Aviation has reiterated the desire of the ministry to reopen the Mallam Aminu Kano International Airport, Kano to international flight operations. Besides, Sirika empha­sized that the continued suspension of international flights to and from the air­port had continued to deny the Ministry and its agencies heavy revenues. James Odaudu, Director, Public Affairs, Ministry of Aviation, in a statement, not­ed that the Minister stated when he received a delegation from Kano State led by Gover­nor Abdullahi Umar Ganduje in his office on Tuesday.

Sirika said it does not make economic sense for the government to spend so much money, as it has done in the airport and just decided to leave it inoperative with the attendant degeneration on infrastructure and redun­dancy amongst operational staff, revenue losses, and hardship to travellers.. He, however, told the dele­gation that comprised some members of the Kano State House of Assembly, represen­tatives of the Emir of Kano, Alhaji Aminu Ado Bayero and members of the Kano Chamber of Commerce, that the decision to suspend inter­national flights to and from the airport, like the ones in Enugu and Port Harcourt were for health and security reasons.
