Lagos- The Guild of Water Purifiers and Researchers of Nigeria (GOWPARN), a foremost group of water producers in Nigeria, has commended the proficiency and high level of professionalism of the National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC), especially the way the agency deals with the issues and matters that affect the public. In a communique signed by President and Secretary of the group, Bassey Christopher and Anrinle Ahmed, during their emergency meeting in Lagos at the weekend, the group commended the Professor Mojisola Adeyeye-led organisation as a people-oriented agency, which no doubt has well-being of all citizens of Nigeria at heart, devoid of gender and race. The statement added that some weeks ago, GOWPARN complained to NAFDAC of alleged marginalisation, where in a meeting was conveyed, but whether by omission or commission, the group was not invited, which nevertheless tended to destabilise members of the group.

However, after extensive deliberations at the meeting by members of the group, the matter was reported to the Director General of NAFDAC, Professor Adeyeye, who without delay, arranged for another meeting between the group and the top management of NAFDAC, presided over by one of the senior Directors in NAFDAC, Sheriff Olagunju, who represented Professor Adeyeye. “This display of maturity, with the arrangement of the meeting in no distant time, to us, as a body, no doubt portrays proficiency, high level of professionalism and diligence on the part of NAFDAC. This is indeed worthy of emulation”, the statement added.
