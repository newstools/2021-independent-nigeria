In line with the theme for this year’s International Women’s Day, “Women In Leadership: Achieving an Equal Future in a COVID-19 World, the Women’s Rights And Health Project (WRAHP) has charged the Federal Government to in­clude women in the COVID-19 vaccination programme. The Non-Governmental Organization (NGO) said that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on women ampli­fied the inequalities they face daily, stressing that women’s voices and experiences should be central to the national and global recovery plan. Speaking at a meeting with journalists on Monday to mark 2021, International Women’s Day, Bose Ironsi, Ex­ecutive Director of WRAHP said it had become important for women to be actively in­volved in the COVID-19 vac­cination programme since a majority of them were at the receiving end during the pan­demic and it would be import­ant to have them represented in the recovery plan.
