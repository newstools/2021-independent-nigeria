This signifies marginal growth in investors’ interest in the company through the year • Viewing financial strength from another angle, we observed that the Equity is same as 36.15% of the Total Assets, this agrees with the Debt Ratio, confirming higher a portion of debt in the assets valuation. • Standing above market Beta, the shares of Nigerian Breweries is academically liquid and slightly above its industry peers in patronage.
