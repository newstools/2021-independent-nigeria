ABUJA – General Lucky Irabor, the Chief of Defence Staff, (CDS), has earned the accolades of the Unity Advocacy Group (UAG) for daring to ensure unity in the nation’s armed forces. During his recent visit to the 2 Division, Nigerian Army, Ibadan, the CDS had dispelled insinuations that disparity existed among security agencies in the country. “The armed forces of today demands that all the services work together, given that the threat that we face requires partnership and collaboration.
