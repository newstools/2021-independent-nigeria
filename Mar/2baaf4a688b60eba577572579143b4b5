This is time for Nigeria to diversify its economy from oil and to fly on the wings of Gas. Our Train 7 will provide about $12billion in Foreign Direct investment to Nigeria and over 12,000 jobs at the peak of construction. Still, even at that, our ambition is to ramp up to Trains 8, 9, 10 and more, with the support of our shareholders and the Federal Government. The transformative effect of this increased use of our Nation’s abundant gas reserves on its economy will be wholly positive and thoroughly beneficial,” she said.

She commended the gas association for recognizing NLNG’s resilience and excellent delivery amidst the COVID-19 global pandemic and ended the companies’ acceptance speech by dedicating the award to a better and prosperous future for Nigeria on the heels of the nation’s decade of gas.
