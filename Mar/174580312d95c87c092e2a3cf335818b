The Petroleum Products Pricing Regulatory Agency (PPPRA) has deleted a template announcing the new price of petrol stands N212.6 per litre from its website. The agency had published the template on its website, http://pppra.gov.ng/pms-guiding-price-for-march-2021/. The publication was greeted with outrage across the nation with fuel queue observed in several filing stations in Abuja and Lagos.

With ex-depot price standing at N206.42 per litre, the March template shows that the landing cost for petrol per litre is N189.61. But the PPPRA, without any explanation in a way seen by many as a U-turn, deleted the template hours later. When The Nation checked around 10:58am, the website page indicated ‘Page not found 404’. To further confirm The Nation’s claim, when INDEPENDENT checked the same website as at 11:18am, the publication was confirmed to have been deleted indeed. Source: The Nation
