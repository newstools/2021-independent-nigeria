LAGOS – Prophet Israel Oladele, the pastor in charge of Ce­lestial Church of Christ, Genesis Global Parish, has partnered with Onyekachi Ubani Foundation to assist the less privileged who are denied justice through ad­ministration of criminal justice system. Oladele, who is presently serving time in a federal cor­rectional facility, is spending much of his time interceding for various inmates, and teach­ing them the word of God, lis­tening to their stories and the ordeals that landed them in a correction facility and counsel­ing them in preparation to life outside prison. He has facilitated the release of some inmates that have been in detention, awaiting trial for good number of years. One of such issue was that of one Azeez Ibrahim, who regained his freedom recently with the intervention of the prophet. The man narrated how he served 10 years and six months at Kirikiri Correctional Centre for wrongful identification. Some inmates have regained their freedom through the ef­fort of the prophet.
