ABUJA – A member of the House of Representatives for Ogoja/Yala Federal Cnstituency and senator-elect for Cross River North Senatorial zone, Hon. Jarigbe Agom Jarigbe, has alleged that some National Assembly staff hid his file from getting to Senate President, Ahmed Lawan, thereby delaying his swearing in for over two weeks. Recall that the Supreme Court had on February 25, 2021 sacked Senator Stephen Odey and declared Jarigbe as the authentic Senator-elect for Cross River North. Despite being sacked by the apex court, Odey has been attending plenary and sponsoring motions on the floor of the senate.

But speaking to journalists in Abuja, Jarigbe fingered his opponent, Odey and the state governor, Ben Ayade, of frustrating his efforts, lamenting that some unscrupulous administrative staff in the parliament for obvious reasons decided to sit on his case file to forestall his being sworn in. He said the file only got to the table of the Senate President on Wednesday after the intervention of the Clerk to the National Assembly (CNA), Arc. Amos Ojo. Gov.

The file only got to the table of the senate president on Wednesday.”
