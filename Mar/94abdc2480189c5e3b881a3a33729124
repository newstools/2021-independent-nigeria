It was during the annual gathering of various secondary schools for the yearly conference of literary and debating society, organized by Ojo Fedilix memorial grammar school that Becky met Michael for the first time. Miss Becky was part of her school delegation for the conference although she took no part in the debate. On the other hand Michael was the head debater representing his school. There is no doubt that Michael is intelligent but also presented his points so well that the panels of judges were amazed due to his age. About five schools took part in the debate and the winner will represent the schools in the state for the federal competition consisting of representatives of all the states in the federation. Part of the federation of this competition is the opportunity for all the students to come together irrespective of the status of the schools in then society.
