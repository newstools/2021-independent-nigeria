The governor of Hawaii has declared a state of emergency after heavy rainfall brought major flooding on two of the major islands. After some areas experienced between one and two feet of rain in less than 24 hours, dams overflowed, mudslides were reported, homes were damaged and with a collapsed bridge. Thousands lost power and many were forced to evacuate on Maui and Oahu, sparking Gov. David Ige to sign an emergency proclamation.
