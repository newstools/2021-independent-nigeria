The Minister said his ministry had already set up a working group on the bilateral consultation, expressing optimism that before the end of the year, the meeting would be revived. He said he had got a commitment from the Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on the issue of forex, saying a meeting on the issue would be held soon. Adebayo, therefore, called on Neitherland investors to take advantage of the African free Continental Free Trade Agreement (AfCFTA) to invest in the country so that they can benefit from the huge continental market worth N4.23trillion and cheap labour in the country. He also urged them to take advantage of the free economic trade zones in the country, saying the government is providing necessary infrastructure, particularly power supply at Kano and Calabar Free Trade Zones. He noted that the Federal Government recently signed an agreement for the provision of 25mw of power to each of the free trade zones in Kano and Calabar. Djik, however, congratulated President Buhari and Adebayo on the emergence of Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala as the Director General of the World Trade organisation, describing it as “diplomatic victory for Nigeria”.
