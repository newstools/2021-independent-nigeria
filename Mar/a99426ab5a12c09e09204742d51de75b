According to Mrs Obiano the challenges of the past one year exercerbated by the advent of the Covid-19 pandemic created artificial distances within families and among relatives thus making the burden of health and physical distance harder to bear. She noted that even with the gradual improvement in health conditions and availability of Coronavirus vaccine, there is still need for caution by everyone in order to ensure that no one derails from the ultimate goal of safety for all. She urged mothers to advise their children to remain committed to the precautionary measures and to adhere strictly to the COVID-19 requirements until health professionals advise otherwise. Continuing, Mrs Obiano called on the Mothers Union to see the increasing cases of divorce among young couples as a challenge which can be addressed through healthy and frank communication with our children at home to ensure that they make the right choices and also understand that marriage is a marathon journey in art of love not a speed chase by the restless.
