ONITSHA  – Tension is gradually building up at the Bridge- Head Market, Onitsha over the appointment of Mr. Sunday Obinze as the Caretaker Committee Chairman of the market. Mr. Obinze was removed by an Onitsha High Court judgement of February 4th this year over the market pre- election matter. But, in what appears to be total disrespect to court judgement, Anambra State Commissioner for Commerce, Trade and Wealth Creation, Chief Uchenna Okafor appointed the embattled market leader as the Caretaker Committee Chairman of the said market.

Mr. Okala alleged that the Commissioner connived with the sacked market leader, Obinze to disorganise the administrative role of the genuine market leaders. According to him, “the Commissioner is still retaining Mr. Obinze as the market leader despite a court judgement against his legitimacy of office because he (Obinze) is protecting his selfish interests to the detriment of the generality of the traders.
