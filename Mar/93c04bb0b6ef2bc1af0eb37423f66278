P/HARCOURT – The ruling All Progressives Congress, APC has been de­scribed as a party without vision and is characterized by division and insecurity. Making the remark in Port Harcourt, Rivers state capital while inaugurating road project in the state, the former governor of Jigawa State, Alhaji Sule Lamido expressed delight that development projects are not only executed in the Port Harcourt city alone but in the hinterland of Rivers State. Lamido said the last five years of the APC led govern­ment has been characterized by division and insecurity. He described the APC as an assemblage of persons drawn from default ACN, ANPP, CPC and propelled by hate, moved by anger, envy and malice.

MADAM ALWAYS WANTS IT BIGGER, STRONGER AND LONG-LASTING!!! “When APC came on board, they had no pro­gramme, they had no plan, the only thing they had was to flush out PDP from gov­ernment because we were performing, because we were organised, because we were committed, because we are compassionate and very humane.” He explained that remod­eling of the airports, reha­bilitation of railway and reform of the power are all PDP initiatives and not that of the APC. According to him, “They can’t think. They have no vision, they have no feeling, they have no com­passion, they are there for the power and the power is there tormenting them, be­cause the power was abused.”
