The Russian COVID-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, is to be produced in Italy from this summer, the Italian-Russian chamber of commerce said on Tuesday. A subsidiary of Swiss pharmaceutical company Adienne Pharma and Biotech is to produce the vaccine in Lombardy. Up to 10 million doses could be produced there by the end of the year, according to the statement.

This is the first deal between a European partner and RDIF, the Russian direct investment fund behind Sputnik V, the chamber of commerce said in its statement.
