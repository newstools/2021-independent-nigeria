Nigerian Breweries Plc, Nigeria’s leading brewers, grew its revenue by 4.3% in the financial year ended December 31, 2020 to N337billion. The growth in revenue was achieved as a result of solid recovery in second half of the review financial year after the debilitating impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the business in first half of the financial year. Revenue grew 21.2% y/y compared to 10.8% y/y decline in H1-2020. But, the huge pressure emanating from rising inflations and naira devaluation impact on raw materials impacted negatively on profitability as gross profit fell year-on-year (YoY) by 9.6% to N118.7billion. The ability of the management of the company to control operating expenses could not salvage both pre-tax and profit after tax from declining by over 50% in the review period as higher finance cost escalated profit shed.

MADAM ALWAYS WANTS IT BIGGER, STRONGER AND LONG-LASTING!!! “Despite controlled operating expenses, higher finance costs (up 50.8% y/y) pressured profitability during the year as pre-tax profits and net income plunged 50.4% and 54.3% to N11.6billion and N7.4billion, respectively,” Analysts at United Capital said. Revenue Growth Strategy Strengthening Food Systems Must Be At Centre Of Africa’s COVID-19 Recovery – AfDB Now That Nigerian Stock Exchange Is Finally Demutualised In first half of 2020, Covid-linked pressures, which led to the closure of on-trade channels (clubs & bars) as well as a ban on social gatherings pressured revenue, which declined 10.8% y/y in H1-2020. However, in H2-2020, the relaxation of Covid-19 restrictions and gradual return to normality supported recovery in revenue. In addition, prior price increase in Nov-2019 and Feb-2020 crystalised. As a result, revenue in H2-2020 grew 21.2% y/y. Overall; FY-2020 revenue grew 4.3% y/y to N337 billion from N323 billion in financial year 2019. Across product segments, the premium beer segment recorded the most impressive growth, growing double-digit, led by gains in Heineken and Tiger. In addition, Nigerian Breweries impressively grew ahead of the market, garnering a stronger market share in FY-2020. Impact of Devaluation and Inflationary Pressures In the review, financial year ended December 31, 2020, cost of sales grew, faster than revenue, up 13.9% y/y to N218.4billion from N191.8billion in FY-2019. Consequently, cost margin grew 542bps y/y to 64.8% in FY-2020. The increase in cost of sales was driven by the increase in the naira cost of imported raw materials (Barley & Hops) due to the devaluation of the naira as well as inflationary pressures on locally sourced materials (Sorghum, Cassava & Packaging Materials). Consequently, gross profit fell 9.6% y/y to N118.7 billion in FY-2020 from N131.3 billion in FY-2019 while gross margin fell 542bps to 35.2% in FY-2020. Reduced commercial activities and controlled personnel cost keep operating expenses (OPEX) in check as operating expenses declined 7.4% y/y to N89.9 billion in FY-2020 from N97.1 billion in FY-2019. The decline in Opex was driven by a synchronised decline in marketing and distribution expenses (down 9.0% y/y) and administrative expenses (down 0.7% y/y). The decline in marketing and distribution expenses was driven by reduced commercial and promotional activities evident in the 13.8% decline in advertising and sales promotion. Also, personnel expenses was kept in check, supporting the flattish decline in administrative expenses. Nevertheless, operating profit declined 15.9% y/y to N29.6 billion in FY-2020. Surge In Debt Escalates Finance Cost In FY-2020, NB actively raised short term debt finance from the capital market, exploiting the low yield environment. Thus, the company’s aggregate debt level surged, climbing higher by 64.1% y/y to N91.4 billion at the end of FY-2020. Consequently, interest expense grew 50.8% y/y to N18.3 billion in FY-2020. Meanwhile, interest income fell 5.5% y/y and consequently pulled net finance cost higher by 52.1% y/y. This pressured pre-tax profits, which declined 50.4% y/y to N11.6 billion for FY-2020, from N23.4 billion in FY-2019. Pilling further pressure, effective tax rate jumped by 532bps to 36.4% for FY-2020, pushing net profit further lower, down 54.3% y/y to N7.4 billion at the end of FY-2020. Looking ahead, we anticipate sustained recovery in revenue supported by volume growth as well as expected price increments by the company. Volume of growth will be supported by improved market acceptance of recently introduced brands and flavours in the premium and malt segment of the company’s product lines. Sustained investment in market channels as well as sustained return to normality would support demand from on-trade channels. Also, we note that the beer industry is in steep losses as it has struggled to pass on cost increases to consumers. However, with the recent surge in costs due to the naira devaluation, brewers are expected to implement more price increments in FY-2021. “We expect this to further support revenue. We forecast a revenue growth of 11.3% y/y to N375.1 billion for FY-2021e,” United Capital disclosed. Following the significant cost pressures in FY-2020, we expect further price increases in FY-2021e. We expect these increases to strengthen the company’s margins and consequently improve profitability. Also, we expect the cost pressures of FY-2020 to dissipate through the course of the year as the FX situation improves. We project Gross margin and Operating margin to edge higher by 178bps y/y and 147bps y/y. Analyst forecast net income growth of 74.8% y/y to N12.9billion in FY 2021e. According to analysts, “We recognise the improved outlook for NB due to improved pricing, volume growth and controlled cost pressures. However, we consider the current price of the stock expensive. NB trades at a PE ratio of 53.8x, a significant premium of 87.8% over our peer average as well as a 35.2% premium over NB’s historical average. Following the updates to our forecasts for FY-2021e, we set a target price of N39.72/s and place a SELL recommendation on the stock due to the 19.8% downside on the stock.”
