This was as a result of the PPPRA’s inability to provide the letters of introduction for us to gain access to the Oil Marketers. “We were therefore unable to confirm that the amounts disbursed were paid to legitimate Marketers,” the query said. Responding, the National President of IPMAN, Elder Chinedu Okoronkwo, told the committee members that the union has over 50,000 members across the country, adding that the agency did not know the real beneficiary of the N80 billion differential. He said: “We have over 50,000 members cut across the nooks and cranny of the country. We don’t know the real beneficiaries of the subsidy payments. If you give us the list of the beneficiaries of the subsidy, we can now reach out to them.”
