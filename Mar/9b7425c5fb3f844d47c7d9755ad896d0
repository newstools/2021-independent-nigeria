LAGOS – A traditional ruler in Yewa North Local Government of Ogun State, Oba Akin­tunde Akinyemi, has ac­cused officials of the Na­tional Border Commission (NBC) of indolence, alleg­ing that they have been in­effective and have not been performing their functions. Oba Akinyemi, the Eselu of Iselu Kingdom, in a tele­phone interview with SUN­DAY INDEPENDENT on Sat­urday, maintained that for a very long time, he has never seen any official of the com­mission in his domain vis­iting to find out how things have been in the area. The monarch, who lamented the porous nature of the border communities, maintained that the border commission, which ought to be overseeing the welfare and development of border areas, had neglected its roles, stress­ing that the officials had long abandoned their responsibil­ities, thereby rendering the agency moribund. HOW NIGERIAN MEN CAN NOW NATURALLY STOP PREMATURE EJACULATION, LOW SPERM COUNT AND OTHER MEN'S SEXUAL NEEDS. MADAM ALWAYS WANTS IT BIGGER, STRONGER AND LONG-LASTING!!! Oba Akinyemi stressed that the agency needed an im­mediate and thorough shake-up to ensure that its impor­tance was felt by the people who he said, had been de­moralised as the area lacked federal presence, especially in areas of development and security. He maintained that the indolence and ineffective­ness of the commission’s officials had contributed to the state of insecurity in border areas, lamenting that his subjects had been migrating to the neighbour­ing Republic of Benin due to insecurity occasioned by frequent attacks by armed Fulani herdsmen.
