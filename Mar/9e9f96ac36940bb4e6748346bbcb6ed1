ABUJA – The African Centre for Justice and Human Right (ACJHR) has said that the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) new policy on remittance inflow will revolutionise the nation’s economy, reduce cost and check round-tripping. Commending the CBN for the introduction of the ‘Naira-for-Dollar’ policy, the ACJHR led by Barrister Nduka Edede Chinwendu, in a statement said, “having assessed the economy and what this policy is capable to achieve within a short period, we dare say that this policy is a game changer as far as our economy is concerned.” The policy, according to the apex bank, offers an incentive of N5 for every $1 of fund remitted to Nigeria through International Money Transfer Organisations in the bank’s new forex policy.
