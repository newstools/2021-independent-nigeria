President Moon Jae-in of South Korea is scheduled to receive an AstraZeneca vaccine shot next week in preparation for participation in a Group of Seven (G-7) summit to be held in Britain. Cheong Wa Dae announced this on Monday, as health authorities had decided to extend the use of the COVID-19 vaccine to the elderly. In accordance with a related procedure drawn up by Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA), Moon and first lady Kim Jung-sook plan to take the vaccine in public on March 23, according to Cheong Wa Dae spokesman Kang Min-seok.
