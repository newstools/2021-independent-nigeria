LAGOS â€“ The private sector Coalition Against COVID-19 (CACOVID), has fulfilled its pledge to the Lagos State Government by donating 260 medical oxygen gas cylinder and newly purchased Incinerator to Yaba Isolation centre in Lagos. Zouera Youssoufou, Managing Director and CEO of Aliko Dangote Foundation, who doubles as an administrator of CACOVID, while speaking to media at the commissioning of the Incinerator and presentation of gas cylinder to Lagos State government, said though a total number of 260 gas cylinder of different sizes were donated to the Lagos State government including incinerator, for now, CACOVID will do more to assist the LASG and other states across the country to ensure that the fight against the deadly coronavirus is finally won. She explained that the incineration is a waste treatment process that involves the combustion of organic substances contained in waste materials, and this will eradicate the risk of the waste from the isolation centre in the community.

She also noted that the incineration can be moved from one centre to another and it can serve the whole isolation centres in the State. Expressing deepest appreciation of the state government to all the members of the CACOVID team, Commissioner for Health for Lagos State, applauded the prompt intervention of the team, at the time the state was in dire need of both oxygen and its cylinders.
