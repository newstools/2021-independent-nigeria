The Chinese leader, who is also the chief of the Communist Party and chairman of the military commission, said military developments must be driven by innovation and there must be further efforts to make science and technology independent. He also said defence-related innovation needs a significant boost. The modernisation and expansion of the Chinese military comes against the backdrop of growing tensions with the United States and Taiwan, incidents on its border with India and disputes over islands in the South China Sea and the East China Sea.(dpa/NAN)
