President Muhammadu Buhari has issued a stern warning to would-be ter­rorists and bandits tar­geting schools, saying the country will not allow the destruction of the school system. The president gave the warning in a statement by his Senior Special Assis­tant on Media and Public­ity, Malam Garba Shehu, in Abuja on Saturday. Buhari was reacting to the invasion of the Fed­eral College of Forestry Mechanization, Afaka, Kaduna, by gunmen on Friday.

The students were ab­ducted in the early hours of Friday. Mr. Samuel Aruwan, Commissioner for Inter­nal Security and Home Affairs in the state said that troops of the Nigeria Army managed to repel the attackers and success­fully rescued 180 students and staff of the college. Aruwan said that 23 fe­male and 16 male students were yet to be accounted for following the attack.
