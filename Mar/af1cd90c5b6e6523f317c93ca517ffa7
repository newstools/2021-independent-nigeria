Speaking on the event, the Group Head, W Initiative at Access Bank, Ayona Trimnell, stressed the need for “increased discussions about real challenges that affect women in the workplace.” “The peculiarities of the global community today means that we are awakened to the successes women can achieve given the right systems and platforms for expression.

Women daily are seen through the lens of stereotypes that exist in the society, marketplace, in the government, corporate organisations, to name a few. Hence to achieve our objectives as women, we need to champion conversations that will cause changes in the various spheres of the society. At Access Bank, we do not only support women but also promote safe spaces for conversations that will further improve lives and the forthcoming Fireside chat is a testament to this fact. We look forward to hosting remarkable women across all walks of life to discuss the best way to chart a course for change”, she concluded
