Management and players of Delta Queens Football Club have felicitated with the President of Nigeria Football Federation (NFF), Amaju Melvin Pinnick, on his election into the FIFA Executive Council. In an interview with Delta Queens’ Media Aide, made available to SATURDAY INDEPENDENT, Henrietta Ehiabor, Chief Executive Officer, Delta Queens’ Football Club, said that Amaju’s elevation into the highest decision-making organ in world football body is no surprise because following his antecedents as a football administrator, he had always been a force in football administration. She noted that Amaju’s entry into the 37-member FIFA Council at the 43rd Ordinary and Elective General Assembly of CAF, which held in Morocco has further defined the focused Delta born football administrator as a dogged and determined player that will continue to do Delta and Nigeria proud. HOW NIGERIAN MEN CAN NOW NATURALLY STOP PREMATURE EJACULATION, LOW SPERM COUNT AND OTHER MEN'S SEXUAL NEEDS. MADAM ALWAYS WANTS IT BIGGER, STRONGER AND LONG-LASTING!!! Acknowledging Amaju as the third Nigerian to serve in world football’s highest decision-making body, after the late Etubom Oyo Orok Oyo and Dr Amos Adamu, the Delta Queens CEO wished him the best in the four-year term, that automatically makes him a Member of the Executive Committee of the Confederation of African Football. It would be recalled that four of Pinnick’s five rivals, stepped down to support him as he later defeated his only rival, incumbent Walter Nyamilandu of Malawi by 43 votes to 8.
