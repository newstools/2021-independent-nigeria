The report also revealed that energy goods imported increased by 236.20% in Q4 2020 compared to Q3 2020 but dropped by 24.1% when compared to Q4 2019.

Mr. Friday Udo, South-South Coordinator of Institute of Chartered Economists of Nigeria (ICEN), in a chart with DIALY INDEPENDENT on the Nigeria’s inability to finance foreign spending with foreign earnings, said: “although Nigeria’s total foreign trade in Q4 2020 was the highest in 2020, the economy reached another highest trade deficit in Q4 2020 (-N2. 73 trillion) since it came out of recession due to the faster growth in its imports than exports”. “It is obvious that revenue from non-oil sector is more feasible and less volatile than the oil revenue. This will facilitate a buoyant and robust economy, which will reduce the need for external debt to the barest minimum. Exploration of the various natural mineral deposits in the country for processing and exportation should be explored to boot export to enable government finance foreign spending”. He advised: “We need to have a properly, articulated, physical and monetary stimulus to support micro, medium and small enterprises to ensure that there is a viable and attractive investment environment in the nation’s economy to attract and retain investors to boost our non-oil productive capacity for exports” Dr. Timothy Olawale, Director -General of Nigeria Employers’ Consultative Association (NECA), in an exclusive interview with DAILY INDEPENDENT, implored the Federal Government to deepen its collaboration with organised businesses with a view to ensuring the formulation and implementation of economic policies that boost the non-oil sector to drive the nation’s export growth. He maintained that despite the growth in the country’s total foreign trade in Q4, 2020, rising to N9.12trillion from N8.38trillion in Q3, 2020, its trade balance is still in the negatives of about N7.38trillion for 2020. He added that on quarter-on-quarter basis, the N2.73trillion trade deficit recorded in Q4, 2020 represents the 5th consecutive quarterly deficit since Q3, 2019 (N1.38trillion). According to him: “As the global economy continues opening up with resumption of activities in the manufacturing (industrial) and aviation sectors, there will be renewed demands for fuels, as crude oil components accounted for the largest portion of our exports, we believe that there will be an improved exports figure for the country. “ In order to improve the trade balance, the country should provide windows for repatriation of exports proceeds, most especially, the non-oil products and promote more backward integration programmes in reducing imports of goods and services, ordinarily, which should be sourced locally to reduce the demand on FX. “With the unpredictable nature of global oil prices and developments in usage of alternative sources of fuel and modern technology, it is more appropriate to hasten the process of diversification of the non-oil economy in expanding the revenue sources away from oil. Dr. Muda Yusuf, Director General of Lagos Chamber Of Commerce and Industry (LCCI), in his response to foreign spending with foreign earnings challenges by the Federal Government, said the recurrent policy inconsistencies that has characterised governance in recent years, especially the contradictions in monetary and fiscal policies created confusion in the system and discouraged investors from investing in the non-oil sector of economy to boost export. He said: We are worried because despite the growth in Nigeria’s total trade in Q4 2020, the economy sunk deeper in trade deficit because the value of Nigeria’s total exports is largely determined by oil which means the stability of Nigeria’s foreign reserve will still be largely determined by the volatility of the oil prices whereas the non-oil sector which could have boosted export earning to finance foreign spending is not competitive enough to fill the gap” Besides, Afrinvest Weekly Update FY:2020 Merchandise Trade Report, stated that despite the growth in Nigeria’s total trade in Q4 2020, the economy sunk deeper in trade deficit which signals the country’s inability to finance her foreign spending with its foreign earnings.
