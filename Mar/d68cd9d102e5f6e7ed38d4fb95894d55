Last month, Pakistan kick-started the vaccination of front-line health workers, but the campaign received a lukewarm response as many were sceptical about the vaccine, a gift from China. The country has now started the vaccination of people aged 60 and above and is awaiting the delivery of the AstraZeneca vaccine. Pakistan has secured 17 million doses of the vaccine and delivery is expected to start by next week. (dpa/NAN)
