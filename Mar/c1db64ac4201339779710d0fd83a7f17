Former Imo State Governor, Rochas Owelle Okorocha, has described the 2023 presidential election as the right time for the South-east to emerge Nigeria’s president. Senator Okorocha (APC-Imo West) stated this on Tuesday while playing host to a pressure group, Ndi Igbo Good Governance Initiative (NGGI). According to the lawmaker who is at loggerhead with his successor, the mood of the country was ripe for a president of Igbo extraction.

Meanwhile, the feud between the former governor of Imo State, Rochas Okorocha and the incumbent governor Hope Uzodinma have appeared to be merely political. This is thought to be so as the two All Progressive Congress chieftains were spotted in laughter with each other in a meeting that involved former national chairman of the APC, Comrade Adams Oshiomhole. Making jokes out of their reported disagreements, Uzodinma who is been referred to as ‘Supreme Court Governor’ by the Peoples Democratic Party, PDP said to Okorocha ‘I don catch you na”. Meaning he has caught Okorocha already.
